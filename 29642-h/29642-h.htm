<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE MOUSE</h3>
</div>
<p>After many long, brooding days of sunshine,
when the clean-cut mountains gleamed brilliantly
against the sky and the grama grass curled
slowly on its stem, the rain wind rose up suddenly out
of Papaguer&iacute;a and swooped down upon the desolate
town of Bender, whirling a cloud of dust before it;
and the inhabitants, man and horse, took to cover.
New-born clouds, rushing out of the ruck of flying
dirt, cast a cold, damp shadow upon the earth and
hurried past; white-crested thunder-caps, piling-up
above the Four Peaks, swept resolutely down to meet
them; and the storm wind, laden with the smell of
greasewood and wetted alkali, lashed the gaunt desert
bushes mercilessly as it howled across the plain.
Striking the town it jumped wickedly against the old
Hotel Bender, where most of the male population had
taken shelter, buffeting its false front until the glasses
tinkled and the bar mirrors swayed dizzily from their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
moorings. Then with a sudden thunder on the tin
roof the flood came down, and Black Tex set up the
drinks.</p>
<p>It was a tall cowman just down from the Peaks
who ordered the round, and so all-embracing was
his good humor that he bid every one in the room
drink with him, even a sheepman. Broad-faced
and huge, with four months&#8217; growth of hair and a
thirst of the same duration, he stood at the end of the
bar, smiling radiantly, one sun-blackened hand toying
with the empty glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come up, fellers,&#8221; he said, waving the other in invitation,
&#8220;and drink to Arizona. With a little more
rain and good society she&#8217;d be a holy wonder, as the
Texas land boomer says down in hell.&#8221; They came
up willingly, cowpunchers and sheepmen, train
hands, prospectors, and the saloon bums that Black
Tex kept about to blow such ready spenders as
he, whenever they came to town. With a practised
jolt of the bottle Tex passed down the line, filling
each heavy tumbler to the brim; he poured a thin one
for himself and beckoned in his roustabout to swell the
count&ndash;&ndash;but still there was an empty glass. There
was one man over in the corner who had declined to
drink. He sat at a disused card table studiously
thumbing over an old magazine, and as he raised his
dram the barkeeper glowered at him intolerantly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the big cowboy, reaching for his
liquor, &#8220;here&#8217;s how&ndash;&ndash;and may she rain for a week!&#8221;
He shoved back his high black sombrero as he spoke,
but before he signalled the toast his eye caught the
sidelong glance of Black Tex, and he too noticed the
little man in the corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he inquired, leaning
over toward Tex and jerking his thumb dubiously
at the corner, and as the barkeeper scowled and
shrugged his shoulders he set down his glass and
stared.</p>
<p>The stranger was a small man, for Arizona, and
his delicate hands were almost as white as a woman&#8217;s;
but the lines in his face were graven deep, without
effeminacy, and his slender neck was muscled like a
wrestler&#8217;s. In dress he was not unlike the men about
him&ndash;&ndash;Texas boots, a broad sombrero, and a canvas
coat to turn the rain,&ndash;&ndash;but his manner was that of
another world, a sombre, scholarly repose such as
you would look for in the reference room of the Boston
Public Library; and he crouched back in his
corner like a shy, retiring mouse. For a moment the
cowman regarded him intently, as if seeking for some
exculpating infirmity; then, leaving the long line of
drinkers to chafe at the delay, he paused to pry into
the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, partner,&#8221; he began, his big mountain voice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
tamed down to a masterful calm, &#8220;won&#8217;t you come
over and have something with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a challenge in the words which did not
escape the stranger; he glanced up suddenly from
his reading and a startled look came into his eyes
as he saw the long line of men watching him. They
were large clear eyes, almost piercing in their intentness,
yet strangely innocent and childlike. For a
moment they rested upon the regal form of the big
cowboy, no less a man than Jefferson Creede, foreman
of the Dos S, and there was in them something
of that silent awe and worship which big men love
to see, but when they encountered the black looks of
the multitude and the leering smile of Black Tex they
lit up suddenly with an answering glint of defiance.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; he said, nodding amiably to the
cowman, &#8220;I don&#8217;t drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>An incredulous murmur passed along the line,
mingled with sarcastic mutterings, but the cowman
did not stir.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, have a cigar, then,&#8221; he suggested patiently;
and the barkeeper, eager to have it over, slapped
one down on the bar and raised his glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you just as much,&#8221; returned the little man
politely, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t smoke, either. I shall have to
ask you to excuse me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a glass of milk, then,&#8221; put in the barkeeper,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
going off into a guffaw at the familiar jest, but the
cowboy shut him up with a look.</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y, certainly,&#8221; he said, nodding civilly to the
stranger. &#8220;Come on, fellers!&#8221; And with a flourish
he raised his glass to his lips as if tossing off the
liquor at a gulp. Then with another downward
flourish he passed the whiskey into a convenient spittoon
and drank his chaser pensively, meanwhile shoving
a double eagle across the bar. As Black Tex
rang it up and counted out the change Creede stuffed
it into his pocket, staring absently out the window
at the downpour. Then with a muttered word about
his horse he strode out into the storm.</p>
<p>Deprived of their best spender, the crowd drifted
back to the tables; friendly games of coon-can sprang
up; stud poker was resumed; and a crew of railroad
men, off duty, looked out at the sluicing waters and
idly wondered whether the track would go out&ndash;&ndash;the
usual thing in Arizona. After the first delirium of
joy at seeing it rain at all there is an aftermath of
misgiving, natural enough in a land where the whole
surface of the earth, mountain and desert, has been
chopped into ditches by the trailing feet of cattle and
sheep, and most of the grass pulled up by the roots.
In such a country every gulch becomes a watercourse
almost before the dust is laid, the <i>arroyos</i> turn to
rivers and the rivers to broad floods, drifting with trees
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
and wreckage. But the cattlemen and sheepmen who
happened to be in Bender, either to take on hands for
the spring round-up or to ship supplies to their shearing
camps out on the desert, were not worrying about
the railroad. Whether the bridges went out or held,
the grass and browse would shoot up like beanstalks
in to-morrow&#8217;s magic sunshine; and even if the Rio
Salagua blocked their passage, or the shearers&#8217; tents
were beaten into the mud, there would still be feed,
and feed was everything.</p>
<p>But while the rain was worth a thousand dollars
a minute to the country at large, trade languished in
the Hotel Bender. In a land where a gentleman
cannot take a drink without urging every one within
the sound of his voice to join in, the saloon business,
while running on an assured basis, is sure to have its
dull and idle moments. Having rung up the two
dollars and a half which Jefferson Creede paid for his
last drink&ndash;&ndash;the same being equivalent to one day&#8217;s
wages as foreman of the Dos S outfit&ndash;&ndash;Black Tex,
as Mr. Brady of the Bender bar preferred to be
called, doused the glasses into a tub, turned them
over to his roustabout, and polished the cherrywood
moodily. Then he drew his eyebrows down and
scowled at the little man in the corner.</p>
<p>In his professional career he had encountered a
great many men who did not drink, but most of them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
smoked, and the others would at least take a cigar
home to their friends. But here was a man who
refused to come in on a treat at all, and a poor, miserable
excuse for a man he was, too, without a word
for any one. Mr. Brady&#8217;s reflections on the perversity
of tenderfeet were cut short by a cold blast of air.
The door swung open, letting in a smell of wet greasewood,
and an old man, his hat dripping, stumbled in
and stood swaying against the bar. His aged sombrero,
blacksmithed along the ridge with copper rivets,
was set far back on a head of long gray hair which
hung in heavy strings down his back, like an Indian&#8217;s;
his beard, equally long and tangled, spread
out like a chest protector across his greasy shirt, and
his fiery eyes roved furtively about the room as he
motioned for a drink. Black Tex set out the bottle
negligently and stood waiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; he inquired pointedly, as the old man
slopped out a drink.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, have one yourself,&#8221; returned the old-timer
grudgingly. Then, realizing his breach of etiquette,
he suddenly straightened up and included the entire
barroom in a comprehensive sweep of the hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come up hyar, all of yoush,&#8221; he said drunkenly.
&#8220;Hev a drink&ndash;&ndash;everybody&ndash;&ndash;no, everybody&ndash;&ndash;come
up hyar, I say!&#8221; And the graceless saloon bums
dropped their cards and came trooping up together.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
A few of the more self-respecting men slipped quietly
out into the card rooms; but the studious stranger,
disdaining such puny subterfuges, remained in his
place, as impassive and detached as ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, young man,&#8221; exclaimed the old-timer jauntily,
&#8220;step up hyar and nominate yer pizen!&#8221;</p>
<p>He closed his invitation with an imperative gesture,
but the young man did not obey.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you, Uncle,&#8221; he replied soberly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, hev a cigar, then,&#8221; returned the old man,
finishing out the formula of Western hospitality, and
once more Black Tex glowered down upon this
guest who was always &#8220;knocking a shingle off his
sign.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, cut it out, Bill,&#8221; he sneered, &#8220;that young feller
don&#8217;t drink ner smoke, neither one&ndash;&ndash;and he
wouldn&#8217;t have no truck with you, nohow!&#8221;</p>
<p>They drank, and the stranger dropped back into
his reading unperturbed. Once more Black Tex
scrubbed the bar and scowled at him; then, tapping
peremptorily on the board with a whiskey glass, he
gave way to his just resentment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, young feller,&#8221; he said, jerking his hand
arbitrarily, &#8220;come over here. Come over here, I said&ndash;&ndash;I
want to talk with you!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment the man in the corner looked up in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
well-bred surprise; then without attempting to argue
the point he arose and made his way to the bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, anyway?&#8221; demanded
Brady roughly. &#8220;Are you too good to drink with
the likes of us?&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger lowered his eyes before the domineering
gaze of his inquisitor and shifted his feet uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t drink with anybody,&#8221; he said at last.
&#8220;And if you had any other waiting-room in your
hotel,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I&#8217;d keep away from your barroom
altogether. As it is, maybe you wouldn&#8217;t mind
leaving me alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this retort, reflecting as it did upon the management,
Black Tex began to breathe heavily and sway
upon his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked you,&#8221; he roared, thumping his fist upon
the bar and opening up his eyes, &#8220;whether you are
too good to drink with the likes of us&ndash;&ndash;me, f&#8217;r instance&ndash;&ndash;and
I want to git an answer!&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaned far out over the bar as if listening for
the first word before he hit him, but the stranger did
not reply immediately. Instead, with simple-minded
directness he seemed to be studying on the matter.
The broad grin of the card players fell to a wondering
stare and every man leaned forward when,
raising his sombre eyes from the floor, the little man
spoke.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;I think I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, <i>what</i>?&#8221; yelled the barkeeper, astounded.
&#8220;You think you&#8217;re what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, say,&#8221; protested the younger man. Then,
apparently recognizing the uselessness of any further
evasion, he met the issue squarely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, since you crowd me to it,&#8221; he cried, flaring
up, &#8220;I <i>am</i> too good! I&#8217;m too good a man to drink
when I don&#8217;t want to drink&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m too good to accept
treats when I don&#8217;t stand treat! And more than
that,&#8221; he added slowly and impressively, &#8220;I&#8217;m too
good to help blow that old man, or any other man,
for his money!&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose to his utmost height as he spoke, turning
to meet the glance of every man in the room, and
as he faced them, panting, his deep eyes glowed with
a passion of conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that is too good for this town,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
get out of it, but I won&#8217;t drink on treats to please
anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gaze of the entire assembly followed him curiously
as he went back to his corner, and Black Tex
was so taken aback by this unexpected effrontery on
the part of his guest that he made no reply whatever.
Then, perceiving that his business methods
had been questioned, he drew himself up and frowned
darkly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Hoity-toity!&#8221; he sniffed with exaggerated concern.
&#8220;Who th&#8217; hell is this, now? One of them little white-ribbon
boys, fresh from the East, I bet ye, travellin&#8217;
for the W. P. S. Q. T. H&#8217;m-m&ndash;&ndash;tech me not&ndash;&ndash;oh
deah!&#8221; He hiked up his shoulders, twisted his head
to a pose, and shrilled his final sarcasms in the tones
of a finicky old lady; but the stranger stuck resolutely
to his reading, whereupon the black barkeeper went
sullen and took a drink by himself.</p>
<p>Like many a good mixer, Mr. Brady of the Hotel
Bender was often too good a patron of his own bar,
and at such times he developed a mean streak, with
symptoms of homicidal mania, which so far had kept
the town marshal guessing. Under these circumstances,
and with the rumor of a killing at Fort
Worth to his credit, Black Tex was accustomed to
being humored in his moods, and it went hard with
him to be called down in the middle of a spectacular
play, and by a rank stranger, at that. The chair-warmers
of the Hotel Bender bar therefore discreetly
ignored the unexpected rebuke of their chief and proceeded
noisily with their games, but the old man who
had paid for the drinks was no such time-server. After
tucking what was left of his money back into his
overalls he balanced against the bar railing for
a while and then steered straight for the dark corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young feller,&#8221; he said, leaning heavily upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
table where the stranger was reading, &#8220;I&#8217;m old Bill
Johnson, of Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket, and I wan&#8217;er shake
hands with you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man looked up quickly and the card
players stopped as suddenly in their play, for Old
Man Johnson was a fighter in his cups. But at last
the stranger showed signs of friendliness. As the
old man finished speaking he rose with the decorum
of the drawing-room and extended his white hand
cordially.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad to meet you, Mr. Johnson,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; protested the old man, &#8220;I do&#8217; wanner sit
down&ndash;&ndash;I wanner ask you a question.&#8221; He reeled,
and balanced himself against a chair. &#8220;I wanner
ask you,&#8221; he continued, with drunken gravity, &#8220;on
the squar&#8217;, now, did you ever drink?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, Uncle,&#8221; replied the younger man, smiling
at the question, &#8220;I used to take a friendly glass,
once in a while&ndash;&ndash;but I don&#8217;t drink now.&#8221; He added
the last with a finality not to be mistaken, but Mr.
Johnson of Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket was not there to urge
him on.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;You&#8217;re mistaken, Mister&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;Mister&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardy,&#8221; put in the little man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah yes&ndash;&ndash;Hardy, eh? And a dam&#8217; good name,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
too. I served under a captain by that name at old
Fort Grant, thirty years ago. Waal, Hardy, I like
y&#8217;r face&ndash;&ndash;you look honest&ndash;&ndash;but I wanner ask
you &#8217;nuther question&ndash;&ndash;why don&#8217;t you drink now,
then?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardy laughed indulgently, and his eyes lighted
up with good humor, as if entertaining drunken men
was his ordinary diversion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you, Mr. Johnson,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I
should drink whiskey the way you folks down here do,
I&#8217;d get drunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y sure,&#8221; admitted Old Man Johnson, sinking
shamelessly into a chair. &#8220;I&#8217;m drunk now. But
what&#8217;s the difference?&#8221;</p>
<p>Noting the black glances of the barkeeper, Hardy
sat down beside him and pitched the conversation
in a lower key.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be all right for you, Mr. Johnson,&#8221; he continued
confidentially, &#8220;and of course that&#8217;s none of
my business; but if I should get drunk in this town,
I&#8217;d either get into a fight and get licked, or I&#8217;d wake
up the next morning broke, and nothing to show for
it but a sore head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s me!&#8221; exclaimed Old Man Johnson, slamming
his battered hat on the table, &#8220;that&#8217;s me, Boy,
down to the ground! I came down hyar to buy grub
f&#8217;r my ranch up in Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket, but look at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
me now, drunk as a sheep-herder, and only six dollars
to my name.&#8221; He shook his shaggy head and fell
to muttering gloomily, while Hardy reverted peacefully
to his magazine.</p>
<p>After a long pause the old man raised his face from
his arms and regarded the young man searchingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you never told me why you refused
to drink with me a while ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; answered Hardy, honestly,
&#8220;and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll understand how it is with me.
I never expect to take another drink as long as I live
in this country&ndash;&ndash;not unless I get snake-bit. One
drink of this Arizona whiskey will make me foolish,
and two will make me drunk, I&#8217;m that light-headed.
Now, if I had taken a drink with you a minute ago
I&#8217;d be considered a cheap sport if I didn&#8217;t treat back,
wouldn&#8217;t I? And then I&#8217;d be drunk. Yes, that&#8217;s
a fact. So I have to cut it out altogether. I like you
just as well, you understand, and all these other gentlemen,
but I just naturally can&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hell,&#8221; protested the old man, &#8220;that&#8217;s all right.
Don&#8217;t apologize, Boy, whatever you do. D&#8217;yer know
what I came over hyar fer?&#8221; he asked suddenly reaching
out a crabbed hand. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell ye. I&#8217;ve
be&#8217;n lookin&#8217; f&#8217;r years f&#8217;r a white man that I c&#8217;d swear
off to. Not one of these pink-gilled preachers but
a man that would shake hands with me on the squar&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
and hold me to it. Now, Boy, I like you&ndash;&ndash;will you
shake hands on that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; responded the young man soberly. &#8220;But
I tell you, Uncle,&#8221; he added deprecatingly, &#8220;I just
came into town to-day and I&#8217;m likely to go out again
to-morrow. Don&#8217;t you think you could kind of look
after yourself while I&#8217;m gone? I&#8217;ve seen a lot of
this swearing-off business already, and it don&#8217;t seem
to amount to much anyhow unless the fellow that
swears off is willing to do all the hard work himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was still a suggestion of banter in his words,
but the old man was too serious to notice it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, boy,&#8221; he said solemnly, &#8220;I can do all
the work, but I jist had to have an honest man to
swear off to.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose heavily to his feet, adjusted his copper-riveted
hat laboriously, and drifted slowly out the
door. And with another spender gone the Hotel
Bender lapsed into a sleepy quietude. The rain hammered
fitfully on the roof; the card players droned
out their bids and bets; and Black Tex, mechanically
polishing his bar, alternated successive jolts of whiskey
with ill-favored glances into the retired corner where
Mr. Hardy, supposedly of the W. P. S. Q. T., was
studiously perusing a straw-colored Eastern magazine.
Then, as if to lighten the gloom, the sun flashed
out suddenly, and before the shadow of the scudding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
clouds had dimmed its glory a shrill whistle from
down the track announced the belated approach of
the west-bound train. Immediately the chairs began
to scrape; the stud-poker players cut for the stakes
and quit; coon-can was called off, and by the time
Number Nine slowed down for the station the entire
floating population of Bender was lined up to see
her come in.</p>
<p>Rising head and shoulders above the crowd and
well in front stood Jefferson Creede, the foreman
of the Dos S; and as a portly gentleman in an unseasonable
linen duster dropped off the Pullman he
advanced, waving his hand largely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, Judge!&#8221; he exclaimed, grinning jovially.
&#8220;I was afraid you&#8217;d bogged down into a washout
somewhere!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, Jeff, not at all,&#8221; responded the old
gentleman, shaking hands warmly. &#8220;Say, this is
great, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; He turned his genial smile upon the
clouds and the flooded streets for a moment and then
hurried over toward the hotel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how are things going up on the range?&#8221;
he inquired, plunging headlong into business and
talking without a stop. &#8220;Nicely, nicely, I don&#8217;t
doubt. I tell you, Mr. Creede, that ranch has
marvellous possibilities&ndash;&ndash;marvellous! All it needs is
a little patience, a little diplomacy, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
understand&ndash;&ndash;<i>and holding on</i>, until we can pass this forestry legislation.
Yes, sir, while the present situation may
seem a little strained&ndash;&ndash;and I don&#8217;t doubt you are having
a hard time&ndash;&ndash;at the same time, if we can only
get along with these sheepmen&ndash;&ndash;appeal to their better
nature, you understand&ndash;&ndash;until we get some protection
at law, I am convinced that we can succeed
yet. I want to have a long talk with you on this
subject, Jeff&ndash;&ndash;man to man, you understand, and between
friends&ndash;&ndash;but I hope you will reconsider your
resolution to resign, because that would just about
finish us off. It isn&#8217;t a matter of money, is it, Jefferson?
For while, of course, we are not making a fortune&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and glanced up at his foreman&#8217;s face,
which was growing more sullen every minute with
restrained impatience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, speak out, Jeff,&#8221; he said resignedly.
&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know dam&#8217; well what it is,&#8221; burst out the tall
cowboy petulantly. &#8220;It&#8217;s them sheepmen. And I
want to tell you right now that no money can hire
me to run that ranch another year, not if I&#8217;ve got to
smile and be nice to those sons of&ndash;&ndash;well, you know
what kind of sons I mean&ndash;&ndash;that dog-faced Jasper
Swope, for instance.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spat vehemently at the mention of the name
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
and led the way to a card room in the rear of the
barroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;ll work your cattle for you,&#8221; he
conceded, as he entered the booth, &#8220;but if you want
them sheepmen handled diplomatically you&#8217;d better
send up a diplomat. I&#8217;m that wore out I can&#8217;t talk
to &#8217;em except over the top of a six-shooter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deprecating protestations of the judge were
drowned by the scuffle of feet as the hangers-on and
guests of the hotel tramped in, and in the round
of drinks that followed his presence was half forgotten.
Not being a drinking man himself, and therefore
not given to the generous practice of treating,
the arrival of Judge Ware, lately retired from the
bench and now absentee owner of the Dos S Ranch,
did not create much of a furore in Bender. All Black
Tex and the bunch knew was that he was holding
a conference with Jefferson Creede, and that if Jeff
was pleased with the outcome of the interview he
would treat, but if not he would probably retire to the
corral and watch his horse eat hay, openly declaring
that Bender was the most God-forsaken hell-hole
north of the Mexican line&ndash;&ndash;for Creede was a man of
moods.</p>
<p>In the lull which followed the first treat, the ingratiating
drummer who had set up the drinks, charging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
the same to his expense account, leaned against
the bar and attempted to engage the barkeeper in
conversation, asking leading questions about business
in general and Mr. Einstein of the New York Store
in particular; but Black Tex, in spite of his position,
was uncommunicative. Immediately after the arrival
of the train the little man who had called him down
had returned to the barroom and immersed himself in
those wearisome magazines which a lunger had left
about the place, and, far from being impressed with his
sinister expression, had ignored his unfriendly glances
entirely. More than that, he had deserted his dark
corner and seated himself on a bench by the window
from which he now looked out upon the storm with a
brooding preoccupation as sincere as it was maddening.
His large deer eyes were fixed upon the distance,
and his manner was that of a man who studies
deeply upon some abstruse problem; of a man with a
past, perhaps, such as often came to those parts,
crossed in love, or hiding out from his folks.</p>
<p>Black Tex dismissed the drummer with an impatient
gesture and was pondering solemnly upon his
grievances when a big, square-jowled cat rushed out
from behind the bar and set up a hoarse, raucous
mewing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, shet up!&#8221; growled Brady, throwing him away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
with his foot; but as the cat&#8217;s demands became more
and more insistent the barkeeper was at last constrained
to take some notice.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s bitin&#8217; you?&#8221; he demanded, peering into
the semi-darkness behind the bar; and as the cat, thus
encouraged, plunged recklessly in among a lot of
empty bottles, he promptly threw him out and fished
up a mouse trap, from the cage of which a slender
tail was wriggling frantically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; he exclaimed, advancing triumphantly into
the middle of the floor. &#8220;Look, boys, here&#8217;s where
we have some fun with Tom!&#8221; And as the card
players turned down their hands to watch the sport,
the old cat, scenting his prey, rose up on his hind
legs and clutched at the cage, yelling.</p>
<p>Grabbing him roughly by the scruff of the neck
Black Tex suddenly threw him away and opened the
trap, but the frightened mouse, unaware of his opportunity,
remained huddled up in the corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out of that,&#8221; grunted the barkeeper, shaking
the cage while with his free hand he grappled the
cat, and before he could let go his hold the mouse
was halfway across the room, heading for the bench
where Hardy sat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ketch &#8217;im!&#8221; roared Brady, hurling the eager cat
after it, and just as the mouse was darting down
a hole Tom pinned it to the floor with his claws.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d I tell ye?&#8221; cried the barkeeper, swaggering.
&#8220;That cat will ketch &#8217;em every time. Look at
that now, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>With dainty paws arched playfully, the cat pitched
the mouse into the air and sprang upon it like lightning
as it darted away. Then mumbling it with a
nicely calculated bite, he bore it to the middle of the
floor and laid it down, uninjured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t he hell, though?&#8221; inquired Tex, rolling his
eyes upon the spectators. The cat reached out cautiously
and stirred it up with his paw; and once more,
as his victim dashed for its hole, he caught it in full
flight. But now the little mouse, its hair all wet and
rumpled, crouched dumbly between the feet of its captor
and would not run. Again and again the cat
stirred it up, sniffing suspiciously to make sure it was
not dead; then in a last effort to tempt it he deliberately
lay over on his back and rolled, purring and
closing his eyes luxuriously, until, despite its hurts,
the mouse once more took to flight. Apparently unheeding,
the cat lay inert, following its wobbly course
with half-shut eyes&ndash;&ndash;then, lithe as a panther, he leaped
up and took after it. There was a rush and a scramble
against the wall, but just as he struck out his
barbed claw a hand closed over the mouse and the little
man on the bench whisked it dexterously away.</p>
<p>Instantly the black cat leaped into the air, clamoring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
for his prey, and with a roar like a mountain bull
Black Tex rushed out to intercede.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put down that mouse, you freak!&#8221; he bellowed,
charging across the room. &#8220;Put &#8217;im down, I say, or
I&#8217;ll break you in two!&#8221; He launched his heavy fist
as he spoke, but the little man ducked it neatly and,
stepping behind a table, stood at bay, still holding
the mouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put &#8217;im <i>down</i>, I tell you!&#8221; shouted the barkeeper,
panting with vexation. &#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;you won&#8217;t, eh?
Well, I&#8217;ll learn you!&#8221; And with a wicked oath he
drew his revolver and levelled it across the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put&ndash;&ndash;down&ndash;&ndash;that&ndash;&ndash;mouse!&#8221; he said slowly and
distinctly, but Hardy only shook his head. Every
man in the room held his breath for the report; the
poker players behind fell over tables and chairs to
get out of range; and still they stood there, the barkeeper
purple, the little man very pale, glaring at
one another along the top of the barrel. In the hollow
of his hand Hardy held the mouse, which tottered
drunkenly; while the cat, still clamoring for his prize,
raced about under the table, bewildered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry up, now,&#8221; said the barkeeper warningly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you five. One&ndash;&ndash;come on, now&ndash;&ndash;two&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>At the first count the old defiance leaped back into
Hardy&#8217;s eyes and he held the mouse to his bosom as
a mother might shield her child; at the second he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
glanced down at it, a poor crushed thing trembling
as with an ague from its wounds; then, smoothing it
gently with his hand, he pinched its life out suddenly
and dropped it on the floor.</p>
<p>Instantly the cat pounced upon it, nosing the body
eagerly, and Black Tex burst into a storm of oaths.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dam&#8217; your heart,&#8221; he yelled, raising his
pistol in the air as if about to throw the muzzle against
his breast and fire. &#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;in&ndash;&ndash;hell&ndash;&ndash;do you
mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Baffled and evaded in every play the evil-eyed barkeeper
suddenly sensed a conspiracy to show him up,
and instantly the realization of his humiliation made
him dangerous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you figure on makin&#8217; a monkey out of
me!&#8221; he suggested, hissing snakelike through his
teeth; but Hardy made no answer whatever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, <i>say</i> something, can&#8217;t you?&#8221; snapped the badman,
his overwrought nerves jangled by the delay.
&#8220;What d&#8217;ye mean by interferin&#8217; with my cat?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a minute the stranger regarded him intently,
his sad, far-seeing eyes absolutely devoid of evil intent,
yet baffling in their inscrutable reserve&ndash;&ndash;then
he closed his lips again resolutely, as if denying expression
to some secret that lay close to his heart,
turning it with undue vehemence to the cause of those
who suffer and cannot escape.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, f&#8217;r Gawd&#8217;s sake,&#8221; exclaimed Black Tex at
last, lowering his gun in a pet, &#8220;don&#8217;t I git <i>no</i> satisfaction&ndash;&ndash;what&#8217;s
your <i>i</i>-dee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s too much of this cat-and-mouse business
going on,&#8221; answered the little man quietly, &#8220;and I
don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t, eh?&#8221; echoed the barkeeper sarcastically;
&#8220;well, excuse <i>me</i>! I didn&#8217;t know that.&#8221;
And with a bow of exaggerated politeness he retired
to his place.</p>
<p>&#8220;The drinks are on the house,&#8221; he announced, jauntily
strewing the glasses along the bar. &#8220;Won&#8217;t
drink, eh? All right. But lemme tell you, pardner,&#8221;
he added, wagging his head impressively,
&#8220;you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to git hurt some day.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE MAN FROM CHERRYCOW</h3>
</div>
<p>After lashing the desert to a frazzle and finding
the leaks in the Hotel Bender, the wind from
Papaguer&iacute;a went howling out over the mesa, still big
with rain for the Four Peaks country, and the sun
came out gloriously from behind the clouds. Already
the thirsty sands had sucked up the muddy
pools of water, and the board walk which extended the
length of the street, connecting saloon with saloon
and ending with the New York Store, smoked with
the steam of drying. Along the edge of the walk,
drying out their boots in the sun, the casual residents
of the town&ndash;&ndash;many of them held up there by the
storm&ndash;&ndash;sat in pairs and groups, talking or smoking
in friendly silence. A little apart from the rest, for
such as he are a long time making friends in Arizona,
Rufus Hardy sat leaning against a post, gazing
gloomily out across the desert. For a quiet, retiring
young man, interested in good literature and bearing
malice toward no one, his day in the Bender barroom
had been eventful out of all proportion to his deserts
and wishes, and he was deep in somber meditation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
when the door opened and Judge Ware stepped out
into the sunshine.</p>
<p>In outward appearance the judge looked more like
a large fresh-faced boy in glasses than one of San
Francisco&#8217;s eminent jurists, and the similarity was
enhanced by the troubled and deprecating glances
with which he regarded his foreman, who towered
above him like a mentor. There was a momentary
conference between them at the doorway, and then,
as Creede stumped away down the board walk, the
judge turned and reluctantly approached Hardy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, sir,&#8221; he began, as the young
man in some confusion rose to meet him, &#8220;but I
should like a few words with you, on a matter of business.
I am Mr. Ware, the owner of the Dos S Ranch&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
you may have heard of it&ndash;&ndash;over in the
Four Peaks country. Well&ndash;&ndash;I hardly know how to
begin&ndash;&ndash;but my foreman, Mr. Creede, was highly impressed
with your conduct a short time ago in the&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;affray
with the barkeeper. I&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;really
know very little as to the rights of the matter, but
you showed a high degree of moral courage, I&#8217;m
sure. Would you mind telling me what your business
is in these parts, Mr.&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardy,&#8221; supplied the young man quietly, &#8220;Rufus
Hardy. I am&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Er&ndash;&ndash;<i>what</i>?&#8221; exclaimed the judge, hastily focussing
his glasses. &#8220;Hardy&ndash;&ndash;Hardy&ndash;&ndash;where have I heard
that name before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose from your daughter, Miss Lucy,&#8221; replied
the young man, smiling at his confusion. &#8220;Unless,&#8221;
he added hastily, &#8220;she has forgotten about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Rufus Hardy!&#8221; exclaimed the judge, reaching
out his hand. &#8220;Why, bless my heart&ndash;&ndash;to be sure.
Why, where have you been for this last year and
more? I am sure your father has been quite worried
about you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope not,&#8221; answered Hardy, shifting his
gaze. &#8220;I guess he knows I can take care of myself
by this time&ndash;&ndash;if I do write poetry,&#8221; he added, with a
shade of bitterness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said the judge, diplomatically changing
the subject, &#8220;Lucy will be glad to hear of you, at
any rate. I believe she&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;wrote you once, some
time ago, at your Berkeley address, and the letter was
returned as uncalled for.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gazed over the rims of his glasses inquiringly,
and with a suggestion of asperity, but the young man
was unabashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will tell Miss Lucy,&#8221; he said deferentially,
&#8220;that on account of my unsettled life I have not
ordered my mail forwarded for some time.&#8221; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
paused and for the moment seemed to be considering
some further explanation; then his manner changed
abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you mentioned a matter of business,&#8221; he
remarked bluffly, and the judge came back to earth
with a start. His mind had wandered back a year or
more to the mysterious disappearance of this same
self-contained young man from his father&#8217;s house, not
three blocks from his own comfortable home. There
had been a servant&#8217;s rumor that he had sent back a letter
or two postmarked &#8220;Bowie, Arizona&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;but old
Colonel Hardy had said never a word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Er&ndash;&ndash;yes,&#8221; he assented absently, &#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;well, I declare,&#8221;
he exclaimed helplessly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve quite forgotten
what it was about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down, then?&#8221; suggested Hardy, indicating
the edge of the board walk with a courtly
sweep of the hand. &#8220;This rain will make good feed
for you up around the Four Peaks&ndash;&ndash;I believe it was
of your ranch there that you wished to speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judge Ware settled down against a convenient
post and caught his breath, meanwhile regarding his
companion curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wanted to talk with
you about my ranch, but I swear I&#8217;ll have to wait
till Creede comes back, now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; answered Hardy easily; &#8220;we can talk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
about home, then. How is Miss Lucy succeeding
with her art&ndash;&ndash;is she still working at the Institute?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed!&#8221; exclaimed the judge, quite mollified
by the inquiry. &#8220;Indeed she is, and doing as
well as any of them. She had a landscape hung at
the last exhibit, that was very highly praised, even
by Mathers, and you know how hard he is to please.
Tupper Browne won the prize, but I think Lucy&#8217;s
was twice the picture&ndash;&ndash;kind of soft and sunshiny, you
know&ndash;&ndash;it made you think of home, just to look at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad to hear that,&#8221; said Hardy, looking
up the ragged street a little wistfully. &#8220;I kind of
lose track of things down here, knocking around from
place to place.&#8221; He seated himself wearily on the
edge of the sidewalk and drummed with his sinewy
white hands against a boot leg. &#8220;But it&#8217;s a great
life, sure,&#8221; he observed, half to himself. &#8220;And by
the way, Mr. Ware,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;if it&#8217;s all the
same to you I wish you wouldn&#8217;t say anything to
your foreman about my past life. Not that there is
anything disgraceful about it, but there isn&#8217;t much
demand for college graduates in this country, you
know, and I might want to strike him for a job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judge Ware nodded, a little distantly; he did not
approve of this careless young man in all his moods.
For a man of good family he was hardly presentable,
for one thing, and he spoke at times like an ordinary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
working man. So he awaited the lumbering approach
of his foreman in sulky silence, resolved to
leave the matter entirely in his hands.</p>
<p>Jefferson Creede bore down upon them slowly,
sizing up the situation as he came, or trying to, for
everything seemed to be at a standstill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he remarked, looking inquiringly from the
judge to Hardy. &#8220;How about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was something big and dominating about
him as he loomed above them, and the judge&#8217;s schoolboy
state of mind instantly returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I really haven&#8217;t done anything about the matter,
Jefferson,&#8221; he stammered apologetically. &#8220;Perhaps
you will explain our circumstances to Mr. Hardy
here, so that we can discuss the matter intelligently.&#8221;
He looked away as he spoke, and the tall foreman
grunted audibly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;they ain&#8217;t much to explain.
The sheepmen have been gittin&#8217; so free up on our
range that I&#8217;ve had a little trouble with &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;and if
I was the boss they&#8217;d be more trouble, you can bet
your life on that. But the judge here seems to think
we can kinder suck the hind teat and baby things
along until they git that Forest Reserve act through,
and make our winnin&#8217; later. He wants to make
friends with these sheepmen and git &#8217;em to kinder go
around a little and give us half a chanst. Well,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
maybe it can be done&ndash;&ndash;but not by me. So I told
him either to get a superintendent to handle the sheep
end of it or rustle up a new foreman, because I see
red every time I hear a sheep-blat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then come the question,&#8221; continued the cowman,
throwing out his broad hand as if indicating the
kernel of the matter, &#8220;of <i>gittin&#8217;</i> such a man, and while
we was talkin&#8217; it over you called old Tex down so good
and proper that there wasn&#8217;t any doubt in <i>my</i> mind&ndash;&ndash;providin&#8217;
you want the job, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and fixed his compelling eyes upon
Hardy with such a mixture of admiration and good
humor that the young man was won over at once,
although he made no outward sign. It was Judge
Ware who was to pass upon the matter finally, and he
waited deferentially for him to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;Jefferson,&#8221; began the judge a little
weakly, &#8220;do you think that Mr. Hardy possesses the
other qualities which would be called for in such a
man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y, sure,&#8221; responded Creede, waving the matter
aside impatiently. &#8220;Go ahead and hire him before
he changes his mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well then, Mr. Hardy,&#8221; said the judge resignedly,
&#8220;the first requisite in such a man is that he
shall please Mr. Creede. And since he commends
you so warmly I hope that you will accept the position.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
Let me see&ndash;&ndash;um&ndash;&ndash;would seventy-five dollars
a month seem a reasonable figure? Well, call it
seventy-five, then&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s what I pay Mr. Creede, and
I want you to be upon an equality in such matters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now as to your duties. Jefferson will have
charge of the cattle, as usual; and I want you, Mr.
Hardy, to devote your time and attention to this matter
of the sheep. Our ranch house at Hidden Water
lies almost directly across the river from one of the
principal sheep crossings, and a little hospitality
shown to the shepherds in passing might be like bread
cast upon the waters which comes back an hundred
fold after many days. We cannot hope to get rid of
them entirely, but if the sheep owners would kindly
respect our rights to the upper range, which Mr.
Creede will point out to you, I am sure we should
take it very kindly. Now that is your whole problem,
Rufus, and I leave the details entirely in your hands.
But whatever you do, be friendly and see if you
can&#8217;t appeal to their better nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>He delivered these last instructions seriously and
they were so taken by Hardy, but Creede laughed
silently, showing all his white teeth, yet without attracting
the unfavorable attention of the judge, who
was a little purblind. Then there was a brief discussion
of details, an introduction to Mr. Einstein
of the New York Store, where Hardy was given
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
<i>carte blanche</i> for supplies, and Judge Ware
swung up on the west-bound limited and went flying
away toward home, leaving his neighbor&#8217;s son&ndash;&ndash;now
his own superintendent and sheep expert&ndash;&ndash;standing
composedly upon the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; remarked Creede, smiling genially as he
turned back to the hotel, &#8220;the Old Man&#8217;s all right, eh,
if he does have fits! He&#8217;s good-hearted&ndash;&ndash;and that
goes a long ways in this country&ndash;&ndash;but actually, I believe
he knows less about the cattle business than any
man in Arizona. He can&#8217;t tell a steer from a stag&ndash;&ndash;honest!
And I can lose him a half-mile from camp
any day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tall cattleman clumped along in silence for a
while, smiling over some untold weakness of his boss&ndash;&ndash;then
he looked down upon Hardy and chuckled to
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re going to be along this trip,&#8221; he
said confidentially. &#8220;Of course I&#8217;m lonely as a lost
dog out there, but that ain&#8217;t it; the fact is, I need
somebody to watch me. W&#8217;y, boy, I could beat the
old judge out of a thousand dollars&#8217; worth of cattle
and he&#8217;d never know it in a lifetime. Did ye ever live
all alone out on a ranch for a month or so? Well,
you know how lawless and pisen-mean a man can git,
then, associatin&#8217; with himself. I&#8217;d&#8217;ve had the old
man robbed forty times over if he wasn&#8217;t such a good-hearted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
old boy, but between fightin&#8217; sheepmen and
keepin&#8217; tab on a passel of brand experts up on the
Tonto I&#8217;m gittin&#8217; so ornery I don&#8217;t dare trust myself.
Have a smoke? Oh, I forgot&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed awkwardly and rolled a cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a match?&#8221; he demanded austerely. &#8220;Um,
much obliged&ndash;&ndash;be kinder handy to have you along
now.&#8221; He knit his brows fiercely as he fired up, regarding
Hardy with a furtive grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he said abruptly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to make friends
with you some way. You <i>eat</i>, don&#8217;t you? All right
then, you come along with me over to the Chink&#8217;s.
I&#8217;m going to treat you to somethin&#8217;, if it&#8217;s only ham
&#8217;n&#8217; eggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>They dined largely at Charley&#8217;s and then drifted
out to the feed corral. Creede threw down some hay
to a ponderous iron-scarred roan, more like a war horse
than a cow pony, and when he came back he found
Hardy doing as much for a clean-limbed sorrel, over
by the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yourn?&#8221; he inquired, surveying it with the keen
concentrated gaze which stamps every point on a cowboy&#8217;s
memory for life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; returned Hardy, patting his pony carefully
upon the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kinder high-headed, ain&#8217;t he?&#8221; ventured Creede,
as the sorrel rolled his eyes and snorted.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; assented Hardy, &#8220;he&#8217;s only been
broke about a month. I got him over in the Sulphur
Springs Valley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knowed it,&#8221; said the cowboy sagely, &#8220;one of them
wire-grass horses&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I bet he can travel, too. Did
you ride him all the way here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clean from the Chiricahuas,&#8221; replied the young
man, and Jefferson Creede looked up, startled.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say you was doin&#8217; over there?&#8221; he
inquired slowly, and Hardy smiled quietly as he answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Riding for the Cherrycow outfit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The hell you say!&#8221; exclaimed Creede explosively,
and for a long time he stood silent, smoking as if in
deep meditation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;I might as well say it&ndash;&ndash;I
took you for a tenderfoot.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE TRAIL OF THE SHEEP</h3>
</div>
<p>The morning dawned as clear on Bender as if
there had never been storm nor clouds, and the
waxy green heads of the greasewood, dotting the level
plain with the regularity of a vineyard, sparkled with
a thousand dewdrops. Ecstatic meadow larks, undismayed
by the utter lack of meadows, sang love
songs from the tops of the telegraph poles; and the
little Mexican ground doves that always go in pairs
tracked amiably about together in the wet litter of
the corral, picking up the grain which the storm had
laid bare. Before the early sun had cleared the top of
the eastern mountains Jefferson Creede and Hardy
had risen and fed their horses well, and while the air
was yet chill they loaded their blankets and supplies
upon the ranch wagon, driven by a shivering Mexican,
and went out to saddle up.</p>
<p>Since his confession of the evening before Creede
had put aside his air of friendly patronage and, lacking
another pose, had taken to smoking in silence;
for there is many a boastful cowboy in Arizona who
has done his riding for the Cherrycow outfit on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
chuck wagon, swamping for the cook. At breakfast
he jollied the Chinaman into giving him two orders
of everything, from coffee to hot cakes, paid for the
same at the end, and rose up like a giant refreshed&ndash;&ndash;but
beneath this jovial exterior he masked a divided
mind. Although he had come down handsomely, he
still had his reservations about the white-handed little
man from Cherrycow, and when they entered the corral
he saddled his iron-scarred charger by feeling, gazing
craftily over his back to see how Hardy would
show up in action.</p>
<p>Now, first the little man took a rope, and shaking
out the loop dropped it carelessly against his horse&#8217;s
fore-feet&ndash;&ndash;and that looked well, for the sorrel stood
stiffly in his tracks, as if he had been anchored. Then
the man from Cherrycow picked up his bridle,
rubbed something on the bit, and offered it to the
horse, who graciously bowed his head to receive it.
This was a new one on Creede and in the excitement of
the moment he inadvertently cinched his roan up two
holes too tight and got nipped for it, for old Bat
Wings had a mind of his own in such matters, and the
cold air made him ugly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, quit that,&#8221; muttered the cowboy, striking
back at him; but when he looked up, the sorrel had already
taken his bit, and while he was champing on it
Hardy had slipped the headstall over his ears.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
There was a broad leather blind on the hacamore,
which was of the best plaited rawhide with a horsehair
tie rope, but the little man did not take advantage of
it to subdue his mount. Instead he reached down
for his gaudy Navajo saddle blanket, offered it to the
sorrel to smell, and then slid it gently upon his back.
But when he stooped for his saddle the high-headed
horse rebelled. With ears pricked suspiciously forward
and eyes protruding he glared at the clattering
thing in horror, snorting deep at every breath. But,
though he was free-footed, by some obsession of the
mind, cunningly inculcated in his breaking, the sorrel
pony was afraid to move.</p>
<p>As the saddle was drawn toward him and he saw
that he could not escape its hateful embrace he leaned
slowly back upon his haunches, grunting as if his fore-feet,
wreathed in the loose rope, were stuck in some
terrible quicksands from which he tried in vain to
extricate them; but with a low murmur of indifferent
words his master moved the saddle resolutely
toward him, the stirrups carefully snapped up over
the horn, and ignoring his loud snorts and frenzied
shakings of the head laid it surely down upon his back.
This done, he suddenly spoke sharply to him, and
with a final groan the beautiful creature rose up and
consented to his fate.</p>
<p>Hardy worked quickly now, tightening the cinch,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
lowering the stirrups, and gathering up the reins. He
picked up the rope, coiled it deftly and tied it to the
saddle&ndash;&ndash;and now, relieved of the idea that he was
noosed, the pony began to lift his feet and prance,
softly, like a swift runner on the mark. At these
signs of an early break Creede mounted hurriedly
and edged in, to be ready in case the sorrel, like most
half-broken broncos, tried to scrape his rider off
against the fence; but Hardy needed no wrangler
to shunt him out the gate. Standing by his shoulder
and facing the rear he patted the sorrel&#8217;s neck with
the hand that held the reins, while with his right hand
he twisted the heavy stirrup toward him stealthily,
raising his boot to meet it. Then like a flash he
clapped in his foot and, catching the horn as his fiery
pony shot forward, he snapped up into the saddle like
a jumping jack and went flying out the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the son of a gun!&#8221; muttered Creede, as he
thundered down the trail after him. &#8220;Durned if he
can&#8217;t ride!&#8221;</p>
<p>There are men in every cow camp who can rope and
shoot, but the man who can ride a wild horse can hold
up his head with the best of them. No matter what
his race or station if he will crawl a &#8220;snake&#8221; and stay
with him there is always room on the wagon for his
blankets; his fame will spread quickly from camp to
camp, and the boss will offer to raise him when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
shows up for his time. Jefferson Creede&#8217;s face was
all aglow when he finally rode up beside Hardy; he
grinned triumphantly upon horse and man as if they
had won money for him in a race; and Hardy, roused
at last from his reserve, laughed back out of pure joy
in his possessions.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that for a horse?&#8221; he cried, raising his voice
above the thud of hoofs. &#8220;I have to turn him loose
at first&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;fraid he&#8217;ll learn to pitch if I hold him in&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s
never bucked with me yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s a snake!&#8221; yelled Creede, hammering
along on his broad-chested roan. &#8220;Where&#8217;d you
git &#8217;im?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Fulton&#8217;s ranch,&#8221; responded Hardy, reining
his horse in and patting him on the neck. &#8220;Turned in
three months&#8217; pay and broke him myself, to boot.
I&#8217;ll let you try him some day, when he&#8217;s gentled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if I wasn&#8217;t so big &#8217;n&#8217; heavy I&#8217;d take you up
on that,&#8221; said Creede, &#8220;but I&#8217;m just as much obliged,
all the same. I don&#8217;t claim to be no bronco-buster
now, but I used to ride some myself when I was a kid.
But say, the old judge has got some good horses runnin&#8217;
on the upper range,&ndash;&ndash;if you want to keep your
hand in,&ndash;&ndash;thirty or forty head of &#8217;em, and wild as
hawks. There&#8217;s some sure-enough wild horses too,
over on the Peaks, that belong to any man that can
git his rope onto &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;how would that strike you?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
We&#8217;ve been tryin&#8217; for years to catch the black stallion
that leads &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Try as he would to minimize this exaggerated estimate
of his prowess as a horse-tamer Hardy was unable
to make his partner admit that he was anything
short of a real &#8220;buster,&#8221; and before they had been on
the trail an hour Creede had made all the plans for a
big gather of wild horses after the round-up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had you spotted for a sport from the start,&#8221; he
said, puffing out his chest at the memory of his
acumen, &#8220;but, by jingo, I never thought I was drawin&#8217;
a bronco-twister. Well, now, I saw you crawl that
horse this mornin&#8217;, and I guess I know the real thing
by this time. Say,&#8221; he said, turning confidentially in
his saddle, &#8220;if it&#8217;s none of my business you can say so,
but what did you do to that bit?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardy smiled, like a juggler detected in his trick.
&#8220;You must have been watching me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I
don&#8217;t mind telling you&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s simply passing a good
thing along. I learned it off of a Yaqui Mayo Indian
that had been riding for Bill Greene on the
Turkey-track&ndash;&ndash;I rubbed it with a little salt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m a son of a gun!&#8221; exclaimed Creede incredulously.
&#8220;Here we&#8217;ve been gittin&#8217; our fingers bit
off for forty years and never thought of a little thing
like that. Got any more tricks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; said Hardy, &#8220;I&#8217;ve only been in the Territory
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
a little over a year, this trip, and I&#8217;m learning,
myself. Funny how much you can pick up
from some of these Indians and Mexicans that can&#8217;t
write their own names, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Umm, may be so,&#8221; assented Creede doubtfully,
&#8220;but I&#8217;d rather go to a white man myself. Say,&#8221; he
exclaimed, changing the subject abruptly, &#8220;what was
that name the old man called you by when he was
makin&#8217; that talk about sheep&ndash;&ndash;Roofer, or Rough
House&ndash;&ndash;or something like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s my front name&ndash;&ndash;Rufus. Why?
What&#8217;s the matter with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217;, I reckon,&#8221; replied Creede absently,
&#8220;never happened to hear it before, &#8217;s all. I was wonderin&#8217;
how he knowed it,&#8221; he added, glancing shrewdly
sideways. &#8220;Thought maybe you might have met him
up in California, or somewheres.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s easy,&#8221; responded Hardy unblinkingly.
&#8220;The first thing he did was to ask me my full name.
I notice he calls you Jefferson,&#8221; he added, shiftily
changing the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; agreed Creede, now quite satisfied,
&#8220;he calls everybody that way. If your name is Jim
you&#8217;re James, John you&#8217;re Jonathan, Jeff you&#8217;re
Jefferson Davis&ndash;&ndash;but say, ain&#8217;t they any f&#8217;r short to
your name? We&#8217;re gittin&#8217; too far out of town for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
this Mister business. My name&#8217;s Jeff, you know,&#8221;
he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sure,&#8221; exclaimed Hardy, brushing aside
any college-bred scruples, &#8220;only don&#8217;t call me
Rough House&ndash;&ndash;they might get the idea that I was
on the fight. But you don&#8217;t need to get scared of
Rufus&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s just another way of saying Red. I had
a red-headed ancestor away back there somewhere
and they called him Rufus, and then they passed the
name down in the family until it got to me, and I&#8217;m
no more red-headed than you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>No</i>&ndash;&ndash;is that straight?&#8221; ejaculated the cowboy,
with enthusiasm, &#8220;same as we call &#8217;em Reddy now,
eh? But say, I&#8217;d choke if I tried to call you Rufus.
Will you stand for Reddy? Aw, that&#8217;s no good&ndash;&ndash;what&#8217;s
the matter with Rufe? Well, shake then,
pardner, I&#8217;m dam&#8217; glad I met up with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>They pulled their horses down to a Spanish trot&ndash;&ndash;that
easy, limping shuffle that eats up its forty miles
a day&ndash;&ndash;and rode on together like brothers, heading
for a distant pass in the mountains where the painted
cliffs of the Bulldog break away and leave a gap down
to the river. To the east rose Superstition Mountain,
that huge buttress upon which, since the day that a war
party of Pimas disappeared within the shadow of its
pinnacles, hot upon the trail of the Apaches, and never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
returned again, the Indians of the valley have always
looked with superstitious dread.</p>
<p>Creede told the story carelessly, smiling at the pride
of the Pimas who refused to admit that the Apaches
alone, devils and bad medicine barred, could have
conquered so many of their warriors. To the west
in a long fringe of green loomed the cottonwoods of
Moroni, where the hard-working Mormons had
turned the Salagua from its course and irrigated the
fertile plain, and there on their barren reservation
dwelt the remnant of those warlike Pimas, the unrequited
friends of the white men, now held by them as
of no account.</p>
<p>As he heard the history of its people&ndash;&ndash;how the
Apaches had wiped out the Toltecs, and the white
men had killed off the Apaches, and then, after pushing
aside the Pimas and the Mexicans, closed in a
death struggle for the mastery of the range&ndash;&ndash;Hardy
began to perceive the grim humor of the land. He
glanced across at his companion, tall, stalwart, with
mighty arms and legs and features rugged as a mountain
crag, and his heart leaped up within him at the
thought of the battles to come, battles in which sheepmen
and cattlemen, defiant of the law, would match
their strength and cunning in a fight for the open
range.</p>
<p>As they rode along mile after mile toward the north
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
the road mounted gently; hills rose up one by one
out of the desert floor, crowned with towering
<i>sahuaros</i>, and in the dip of the pass ahead a mighty
forest of their misshapen stalks was thrust up like
giant fingers against the horizon. The trail wound
in among them, where they rose like fluted columns
above the lesser cactus&ndash;&ndash;great skin-covered tanks,
gorged fat with water too bitter to quench the fieriest
thirst, yet guarded jealously by poison-barbed spines.
Gilded woodpeckers, with hearts red as blood painted
upon their breasts, dipped in uneven flight from
<i>sahuaro</i> to <i>sahuaro</i>, dodged into holes of their own
making, dug deep into the solid flesh; sparrow hawks
sailed forth from their summits, with quick eyes
turned to the earth for lizards; and the brown mocking
bird, leaping for joy from the ironwood tree where his
mate was nesting, whistled the praise of the desert in
the ecstatic notes of love. In all that land which some
say God forgot, there was naught but life and happiness,
for God had sent the rain.</p>
<p>The sun was high in the heavens when, as they
neared the summit of the broad pass, a sudden taint
came down the wind, whose only burden had been the
fragrance of resinous plants, of wetted earth, and
of green things growing. A distant clamor, like the
babble of many voices or the surf-beats of a mighty
sea, echoed dimly between the <i>chuck-a-chuck</i> of their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
horses&#8217; feet, and as Hardy glanced up inquiringly his
companion&#8217;s lip curled and he muttered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheep!&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode on in silence. The ground, which before
had been furred with Indian wheat and sprouting six
weeks&#8217; grass, now showed the imprints of many tiny
feet glozed over by the rain, and Hardy noticed
vaguely that something was missing&ndash;&ndash;the grass was
gone. Even where a minute before it had covered
the level flats in a promise of maturity, rising up in
ranker growth beneath the thorny trees and cactus, its
place was now swept bare and all the earth trampled
into narrow, hard-tamped trail. Then as a brush
shed and corrals, with a cook tent and a couple of
water wagons in the rear, came into view, the ground
went suddenly stone bare, stripped naked and
trampled smooth as a floor. Never before had Hardy
seen the earth so laid waste and desolate, the very
cactus trimmed down to its woody stump and every
spear of root grass searched out from the shelter of
the spiny <i>chollas</i>. He glanced once more at his companion,
whose face was sullen and unresponsive; there
was a well-defined bristle to his short mustache and he
rowelled his horse cruelly when he shied at the blatting
horde.</p>
<p>The shearing was in full blast, every man working
with such feverish industry that not one of them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
stopped to look up. From the receiving corral three
Mexicans in slouched hats and jumpers drove the
sheep into a broad chute, yelling and hurling battered
oil cans at the hindmost; by the chute an American
punched them vigorously forward with a prod, and
yet another thrust them into the pens behind the
shearers, who bent to their work with a sullen, back-breaking
stoop. Each man held between his knees
a sheep, gripped relentlessly, that flinched and
kicked at times when the shears clipped off
patches of flesh; and there in the clamor of a
thousand voices they shuttled their keen blades
unceasingly, stripping off a fleece, throwing it
aside, and seizing a fresh victim by the foot, toiling
and sweating grimly. By another chute a man
stood with a paint pot, stamping a fresh brand
upon every new-shorn sheep, and in a last corral
the naked ones, their white hides spotted with
blood from their cuts, blatted frantically for their
lambs. These were herded in a small inclosure,
some large and browned with the grime of the
flock, others white and wobbly, newborn from mothers
frightened in the shearing; and always that tremendous
wailing chorus&ndash;&ndash;<i>Ba-a-a</i>, <i>ba-a-a</i>, <i>ba-a-a</i>&ndash;&ndash;and men
in greasy clothes wrestling with the wool.</p>
<p>To a man used to the noise and turmoil of the
round-up and branding pen and accustomed to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
necessary cruelties of stock raising there was nothing
in the scene to attract attention. But Hardy was of
gentler blood, inured to the hardships of frontier life
but not to its unthinking brutality, and as he beheld
for the first time the waste, the hurry, the greed of it
all, his heart turned sick and his eyes glowed with
pity, like a woman&#8217;s. By his side the sunburned
swarthy giant who had taken him willy-nilly for a
friend sat unmoved, his lip curled, not at the pity of it,
but because they were sheep; and because, among the
men who rushed about driving them with clubs and
sacks, he saw more than one who had eaten at his table
and then sheeped out his upper range. His saturnine
mood grew upon him as he waited and, turning to
Hardy, he shouted harshly:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some of your friends over yonder,&#8221; he
said, jerking his thumb toward a group of men who
were weighing the long sacks of wool. &#8220;Want to go
over and get acquainted?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardy woke from his dream abruptly and shook
his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, let&#8217;s not stop,&#8221; he said, and Creede laughed
silently as he reined Bat Wings into the trail. But
just as they started to go one of the men by the scales
hailed them, motioning with his hand and, still laughing
cynically, the foreman of the Dos S turned back
again.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Jim Swope,&#8221; he said, &#8220;one of our big sheep
men&ndash;&ndash;nice feller&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll like him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led the way to the weighing scales, where two
sweating Mexicans tumbled the eight-foot bags upon
the platform, and a burly man with a Scotch turn to
his tongue called off the weights defiantly. At his
elbow stood two men, the man who had called them
and a wool buyer,&ndash;&ndash;each keeping tally of the count.</p>
<p>Jim Swope glanced quickly up from his work. He
was a man not over forty but bent and haggard, with
a face wrinkled deep with hard lines, yet lighted by
blue eyes that still held a twinkle of grim humor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Jeff,&#8221; he said, jotting down a number in
his tally book, &#8220;goin&#8217; by without stoppin&#8217;, was ye?
Better ask the cook for somethin&#8217; to eat. Say, you&#8217;re
goin&#8217; up the river, ain&#8217;t ye? Well, tell Pablo Moreno
and them Mexicans I lost a cut of two hundred sheep
up there somewhere. That son of a&ndash;&ndash;of a herder of
mine was too lazy to make a corral and count &#8217;em, so
I don&#8217;t know where they are lost, but I&#8217;ll give two
bits a head for &#8217;em, delivered here. Tell the old man
that, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused to enter another weight in his book, then
stepped away from the scales and came out to meet
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the feed up your way?&#8221; he inquired, smiling
grimly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Dam&#8217; pore,&#8221; replied Creede, carrying on the jest,
&#8220;and it&#8217;ll be poorer still if you come in on me, so keep
away. Mr. Swope, I&#8217;ll make you acquainted with
Mr. Hardy&ndash;&ndash;my new boss. Judge Ware has sent
him out to be superintendent for the Dos S.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to meet you, sir,&#8221; said Swope, offering a
greasy hand that smelled of sheep dip. &#8220;Nice man,
the old judge&ndash;&ndash;here, <i>umbre</i>, put that bag on straight!
Three hundred and <i>fifteen</i>? Well I know a dam&#8217;
sight better&ndash;&ndash;excuse me, boys&ndash;&ndash;here, put that bag on
again, and weigh it right!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; observed Creede, glancing at his friend as
the combat raged unremittingly, &#8220;I guess we might
as well pull. His busy day, you understand. Nice
feller, though&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll like &#8217;im.&#8221; Once more the glint
of quiet deviltry came into his eyes, but he finished
out the jest soberly. &#8220;Comes from a nice Mormon
family down in Moroni&ndash;&ndash;six brothers&ndash;&ndash;all sheepmen.
You&#8217;ll see the rest of the boys when they come
through next month&ndash;&ndash;but Jim&#8217;s the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was something in the sardonic smile that
accompanied this encomium which set Hardy thinking.
Creede must have been thinking too, for he
rode past the kitchen without stopping, cocking his
head up at the sun as if estimating the length of their
journey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, did you want to git somethin&#8217; to eat?&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
inquired innocently. &#8220;No? That&#8217;s good. That
sheep smell kinder turns my stomach.&#8221; And throwing
the spurs into Bat Wings he loped rapidly toward
the summit, scowling forbiddingly in passing at a
small boy who was shepherding the stray herd. For
a mile or two he said nothing, swinging his head
to scan the sides of the mountains with eyes as
keen as an eagle&#8217;s; then, on the top of the last roll, he
halted and threw his hand out grandly at the panorama
which lay before them.</p>
<p>&#8220;There she lays,&#8221; he said, as if delivering a funeral
oration, &#8220;as good a cow country as God ever made&ndash;&ndash;and
now even the jack rabbits have left it. D&#8217;ye see
that big mesa down there?&#8221; he continued, pointing to
a broad stretch of level land, dotted here and there
with giant cactus, which extended along the river.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a thousand head of cattle, fat as butter,
feedin&#8217; where you see them <i>sahuaros</i>, and now look
at it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He threw out his hand again in passionate appeal,
and Hardy saw that the mesa was empty.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was grass a foot high,&#8221; cried Creede in a
hushed, sustained voice, as if he saw it again, &#8220;and
flowers. Me and my brothers and sisters used to run
out there about now and pick all kinds, big yaller
poppies and daisies, and these here little pansies&ndash;&ndash;and
ferget-me-nots. God! I wish I could ferget &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
I&#8217;ve been fightin&#8217; these sheep so long and gittin&#8217;
so mean and ugly them flowers wouldn&#8217;t mean no
more to me now than a bunch of jimson weeds and
stink squashes. But hell, what&#8217;s the use?&#8221; He
threw out his hands once more, palms up, and
dropped them limply.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s old Pablo Moreno&#8217;s place down there,&#8221; he
said, falling back abruptly into his old way. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
stop there overnight&ndash;&ndash;I want to help git that wagon
across the river when Rafael comes in bymeby, and
we&#8217;ll go up by trail in the mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more he fell into his brooding silence, looking
up at the naked hills from habit, for there were no
cattle there. And Rufus Hardy, quick to understand,
gazed also at the arid slopes, where once the
grama had waved like tawny hair in the soft winds
and the cattle of Jeff Creede&#8217;s father had stood knee-high
in flowers.</p>
<p>Now at last the secret of Arizona-the-Lawless and
Arizona-the-Desert lay before him: the feed was
there for those who could take it, and the sheep were
taking it all. It was government land, only there
was no government; anybody&#8217;s land, to strip, to lay
waste, to desolate, to hog for and fight over forever&ndash;&ndash;and
no law of right; only this, that the best fighter
won. Thoughts came up into his mind, as thoughts
will in the silence of the desert; memories of other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
times and places, a word here, a scene there, having no
relation to the matter in hand; and then one flashed up
like the premonitions of the superstitious&ndash;&ndash;a verse
from the Bible that he had learned at his mother&#8217;s
knee many years before:</p>
<p>&#8220;Crying, Peace, Peace, when there is no peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he put it aside lightly, as a man should, for if
one followed every vagrant fancy and intuition,
taking account of signs and omens, he would slue and
waver in his course like a toy boat in a mill pond,
which after great labor and adventure comes, in the
end, to nothing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>DON PABLO MORENO</h3>
</div>
<p>On the edge of the barren mesa and looking out
over the sandy flats where the Salagua writhed
about uneasily in its bed, the <i>casa</i> of Don Pablo
Moreno stood like a mud fort, barricaded by a
palisade of the thorny cactus which the Mexicans call
<i>ocotilla</i>. Within this fence, which inclosed several
acres of standing grain and the miniature of a
garden, there were all the signs of prosperity&ndash;&ndash;a new
wagon under its proper shade, a storehouse strongly
built where chickens lingered about for grain, a
clean-swept <i>ramada</i> casting a deep shadow across
the open doorway; but outside the inclosure the
ground was stamped as level as a threshing floor.
As Creede and Hardy drew near, an old man,
grave and dignified, came out from the shady veranda
and opened the gate, bowing with the most courtly
hospitality.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Buenos tardes, se&ntilde;ores</i>,&#8221; he pronounced, touching
his hat in a military salute. &#8220;<i>Pasa!</i> Welcome to my
poor house.&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to these salutations Creede made the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
conventional replies, and then as the old man stood
expectant he said in a hurried aside to Hardy:</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye talk Spanish? He don&#8217;t understand a word
of English.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; returned Hardy. &#8220;I was brought up on
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; exclaimed Creede incredulously, and then,
addressing the Se&ntilde;or Moreno in his native tongue, he
said: &#8220;Don Pablo, this is my friend Se&ntilde;or Hardy,
who will live with me at Agua Escondida!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With great pleasure, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; said the old gentleman,
removing his hat, &#8220;I make your acquaintance!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The pleasure is mine,&#8221; replied Hardy, returning
the salutation, and at the sound of his own language
Don Pablo burst into renewed protestations of
delight. Within the cool shadow of his <i>ramada</i> he
offered his own chair and seated himself in another,
neatly fashioned of mesquite wood and strung with
thongs of rawhide. Then, turning his venerable head
to the doorway which led to the inner court, he shouted
in a terrible voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Muchacho</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly from behind the adobe wall, around the
corner of which he had been slyly peeping, a black-eyed
boy appeared and stood before him, his ragged
straw hat held respectfully against his breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Sus manos!</i>&#8221; roared the old man; and dropping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
his hat the <i>muchacho</i> touched his hands before him in
an attitude of prayer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give the gentlemen a drink!&#8221; commanded Don
Pablo severely, and after Hardy had accepted the
gourd of cold water which the boy dipped from a
porous <i>olla</i>, resting in the three-pronged fork of a
trimmed mesquite, the old gentleman called for his
tobacco. This the <i>mozo</i> brought in an Indian basket
wrought by the Apaches who live across the river&ndash;&ndash;Bull
Durham and brown paper. The se&ntilde;or offered
these to his guest, while Creede grinned in anticipation
of the outcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; exclaimed the Se&ntilde;or Moreno, astounded.
&#8220;You do not smoke? Ah, perhaps it is my poor
tobacco! But wait, I have a cigarro which the storekeeper
gave me when I&ndash;&ndash;No? No smoke nothing?
Ah, well, well&ndash;&ndash;no smoke, no Mexicano, as the
saying goes.&#8221; He regarded his guest doubtfully,
with a shadow of disfavor. Then, rolling a cigarette,
he remarked: &#8220;You have a very white skin, Se&ntilde;or
Hardy; I think you have not been in Arizona very
long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a year,&#8221; replied Hardy modestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Muchacho!</i>&#8221; cried the se&ntilde;or. &#8220;Run and tell the
se&ntilde;ora to hasten the dinner. And where,&#8221; he inquired,
with the shrewd glance of a country lawyer,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
&#8220;and where did you learn, then, this excellent Spanish
which you speak?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At Old Camp Verde, to the north,&#8221; replied Hardy
categorically, and at the name Creede looked up with
sudden interest. &#8220;I lived there when I was a boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; exclaimed Don Pablo, raising his eyebrows.
&#8220;And were your parents with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; answered Hardy, &#8220;my father was an
officer at the post.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, <i>s&iacute;</i>, <i>s&iacute;</i>, <i>s&iacute;</i>,&#8221; nodded the old man vigorously, &#8220;now
I understand. Your father fought the Apaches and
you played with the little Mexican boys, no? But
now your skin is white&ndash;&ndash;you have not lived long under
our sun. When the Apaches were conquered your
parents moved, of course&ndash;&ndash;they are in San Francisco
now, perhaps, or Nuevo York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father is living near San Francisco,&#8221; admitted
Hardy, &#8220;but,&#8221; and his voice broke a little at the
words, &#8220;my mother has been dead many years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, indeed,&#8221; exclaimed Don Pablo sympathetically,
&#8220;I am very sorry. My own <i>madre</i> has been
many years dead also. But what think you of
our country? Is it not beautiful?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; responded Hardy honestly, &#8220;and
you have a wonderful air here, very sweet and pure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Seguro!</i>&#8221; affirmed the old man, &#8220;<i>seguro que s&iacute;!</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
But alas,&#8221; he added sadly, &#8220;one cannot live on air
alone. Ah, <i>que malo</i>, how bad these sheep are!&#8221;</p>
<p>He sighed, and regarded his guest sadly with eyes
that were bloodshot from long searching of the hills
for cattle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember the day when the first sheep came,&#8221;
he said, in the manner of one who begins a set narration.
&#8220;In the year of &#8217;91 the rain came, more, more,
more, until the earth was full and the excess made
<i>lagunas</i> on the plain. That year the Salagua left all
bounds and swept my fine fields of standing corn
away, but we did not regret it beyond reason for the
grass came up on the mesas high as a horse&#8217;s belly,
and my cattle and those of my friend Don Lu&iacute;s, the
good father of Jeff, here, spread out across the plains
as far as the eye could see, and every cow raised her
calf. But look! On the next year no rain came, and
the river ran low, yet the plains were still yellow with
last year&#8217;s grass. All would have been well now as
before, with grass for all, when down from the north
like grasshoppers came the <i>borregos</i>&ndash;&ndash;<i>baaa</i>, <i>baaa</i>,
<i>baaa</i>&ndash;&ndash;thousands of them, and they were starving.
Never had I seen bands of sheep before in Arizona,
nor the father of Don Jeff, but some say they had
come from California in &#8217;77, when the drought visited
there, and had increased in Yavapai and fed out all the
north country until, when this second <i>a&ntilde;o seco</i> came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
upon them, there was no grass left to eat. And now,
<i>amigo</i>, I will tell you one thing, and you may believe
it, for I am an old man and have dwelt here long: it
is not God who sends the dry years, but the sheep!</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mira!</i> I have seen the mowing machine of the
Americano cut the tall grass and leave all level&ndash;&ndash;so
the starved sheep of Yavapai swept across our mesa
and left it bare. Yet was there feed for all, for our
cattle took to the mountains and browsed higher on
the bushes, above where the sheep could reach; and
the sheep went past and spread out on the southern
desert and were lost in it, it was so great.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was all, you will say&ndash;&ndash;but no! In the Spring
every ewe had her lamb, and many two, and they grew
fat and strong, and when the grass became dry on the
desert because the rains had failed again, they came
back, seeking their northern range where the weather
was cool, for a sheep cannot endure the heat. Then
we who had let them pass in pity were requited after
the way of the <i>borregueros</i>&ndash;&ndash;we were sheeped out,
down to the naked rocks, and the sheepmen went on,
laughing insolently. <i>Ay, que malo los borregueros</i>,
what devils they are; for hunger took the strength
from our cows so that they could not suckle their
calves, and in giving birth many mothers and their
little ones died together. In that year we lost half
our cows, Don Lu&iacute;s Creede and I, and those that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
lived became thin and rough, as they are to this day,
from journeying to the high mountains for feed and
back to the far river for water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the father of Jeff became very angry, so
that he lost weight and his face became changed,
and he took an oath that the first sheep or sheep-herder
that crossed his range should be killed, and
every one thereafter, as long as he should live. Ah,
what a <i>buen hombre</i> was Don Lu&iacute;s&ndash;&ndash;if we had one
man like him to-day the sheep would yet go round&ndash;&ndash;a
big man, with a beard, and he had no fear, no not
for a hundred men. And when in November the
sheep came bleating back, for they had promised so
to do as soon as the feed was green, Don Lu&iacute;s met
them at the river, and he rode along its bank, night
and day, promising all the same fate who should come
across&ndash;&ndash;and, <i>umbre</i>, the sheep went round!&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man slapped his leg and nodded his head
solemnly. Then he looked across at Creede and his
voice took on a great tenderness. &#8220;My friend has
been dead these many years,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but he was a
true man.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Don Pablo finished his story the Se&ntilde;ora opened
the door of the kitchen where the table was already
set with boiled beans, meat stewed with peppers, and
thin corn cakes&ndash;&ndash;the conventional <i>frijoles</i>, <i>carne con
chili</i>, and <i>tortillas</i> of the Mexicans&ndash;&ndash;and some fried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
eggs in honor of the company. As the meal progressed
the Se&ntilde;ora maintained a discreet silence,
patting out <i>tortillas</i> and listening politely to her husband&#8217;s
stock of stories, for Don Pablo was lord in his
own house. The big-eyed <i>muchacho</i> sat in the corner,
watching the corn cakes cook on the top of the stove
and battening on the successive rations which were
handed out to him. There were stories, as they ate,
of the old times, of the wars and revolutions of
Sonora, wherein the Se&ntilde;or Moreno had taken too
brave a part, as his wounds and exile showed; strange
tales of wonders and miracles wrought by the Indian
doctors of Alt&aacute;r; of sacred snakes with the sign of the
cross blazoned in gold on their foreheads, worshipped
by the Indians with offerings of milk and tender
chickens; of primitive life on the <i>haciendas</i> of Sonora,
where men served their masters for life and were
rewarded at the end with a pension of beans and <i>carne
seco</i>.</p>
<p>Then as the day waned they sat at peace in the
<i>ramada</i>, Moreno and Creede smoking, and Hardy
watching the play of colors as the sun touched
the painted crags of the Bulldog and lighted up
the square summit of Red Butte across the river,
throwing mysterious shadows into the black gorge
which split it from crown to base. Between that
high cliff and the cleft red butte flowed the Salagua,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
squirming through its tortuous ca&ntilde;on, and beyond
them lay Hidden Water, the unknown, whither a
single man was sent to turn back the tide of sheep.</p>
<p>In the silence the tinkle of bells came softly from
up the ca&ntilde;on and through the dusk Hardy saw a herd
of goats, led by a long-horned ram, trailing slowly
down from the mesa. They did not pause, either to
rear up on their hind feet for browse or to snoop
about the gate, but filed dutifully into their own
corral and settled down for the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your goats are well trained, Don Pablo,&#8221; said
Hardy, by way of conversation. &#8220;They come home
of their own accord.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, no,&#8221; protested Moreno, rising from his chair.
&#8220;It is not the goats but my goat dogs that are well
trained. Come with me while I close the gate and I
will show you my flock.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old gentleman walked leisurely down the trail
to the corral, and at their approach Hardy saw two
shaggy dogs of no breed suddenly detach themselves
from the herd and spring defiantly forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Quita se, quita se!&#8221;</i> commanded Don Pablo, and
at his voice they halted, still growling and baring their
fangs at Hardy.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mira</i>,&#8221; exclaimed the old man, &#8220;are they not
<i>bravo</i>? Many times the <i>borregueros</i> have tried to
steal my bucks to lead their timid sheep across the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
river, but Tira and Diente fight them like devils.
One Summer for a week the <i>chivas</i> did not return,
having wandered far up into the mountains, but in
the end Tira and Diente fetched them safely home.
See them now, lying down by the mother goat that
suckled them; you would not believe it, but they
think they are goats.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed craftily at the idea, and at Hardy&#8217;s
eager questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Seguro</i>,&#8221; he said, &#8220;surely I will tell you about my
goat dogs, for you Americans often think the Mexicans
are <i>tonto</i>, having no good sense, because our
ways are different. When I perceived that my cattle
were doomed by reason of the sheep trail crossing the
river here at my feet I bought me a she-goat with
kids, and a ram from another flock. These I herded
myself along the brow of the hill, and they soon
learned to rear up against the bushes and feed upon
the browse which the sheep could not reach. Thus
I thought that I might in time conquer the sheep,
fighting the devil with fire; but the coyotes lay
in wait constantly to snatch the kids, and once when
the river was high the <i>borregueros</i> of Jeem Swopa
stole my buck to lead their sheep across.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I remembered a trick of my own people in
Sonora, and I took the blind pups of a dog, living far
from here, and placed each of them with a she-goat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
having one newborn kid; and while the kid was sucking
at one teat the mother could not help but let down
milk for the puppy at the other, until at last when the
dog smell had left him she adopted him for her own.
Now as the pups grew up they went out on the
hills with their goat mother, and when, they being
grown, she would no longer suckle them, they stole
milk from the other she-goats; and so they live to-day,
on milk and what rabbits they can catch. But
whenever they come to the house I beat them and
drive them back&ndash;&ndash;their nature is changed now, and
they love only goats. Eight years ago I raised my
first goat dogs, for many of them desert their mothers
and become house dogs, and now I have over a
hundred goats, which they lead out morning and
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man lashed fast the gate to the corral and
turned back toward the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; he said musingly, &#8220;the Americanos say
continually that we Mexicanos are foolish&ndash;&ndash;but look
at me! Here is my good home, the same as before.
I have always plenty beans, plenty meat, plenty flour,
plenty coffee. I welcome every one to my house, to
eat and sleep&ndash;&ndash;yet I have plenty left. I am <i>muy
contento</i>, Se&ntilde;or Hardy&ndash;&ndash;yes, I am always happy.
But the Americanos? No! When the sheep come,
they fight; when their cattle are gone, they move;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
fight, fight; move, move; all the time.&#8221; He sighed
and gazed wearily at the barren hills.</p>
<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;or Hardy,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;you are young, yet
you have seen the great world&ndash;&ndash;perhaps you will understand.
Jeff tells me you come to take charge of
the Dos S Rancho, where the sheep come through by
thousands, even as they did here when there was grass.
I am an old man now; I have lived on this spot
twenty-four years and seen much of the sheep; let me
advise you.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the sheepmen come across the river do not
fight, as Don Jeff does continually, but let them pass.
They are many and the cowmen are few; they are
rich and we are very poor; how then can a few men
whip many, and those armed with the best? And
look&ndash;&ndash;if a sheepman is killed there is the law, you
know, and lawyers&ndash;&ndash;yes, and money!&#8221; He shrugged
his shoulders and threw out his hands, peeping ruefully
through the fingers to symbolize prison bars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it not so?&#8221; he asked, and for the first time an
Americano agreed with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing more, then,&#8221; said Don Pablo, lowering
his voice and glancing toward the house, where Creede
was conversing with the Se&ntilde;ora. &#8220;The <i>pap&aacute;</i> of Don
Jeff yonder was a good man, but he was a fighting
Texano&ndash;&ndash;and Jeff is of the same blood. Each year
as the sheep come through I have fear for him, lest he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
should kill some saucy <i>borreguero</i> and be sent to
prison; for he has angry fits, like his father, and there
are many bad men among the sheep-herders,&ndash;&ndash;escaped
criminals from Old Mexico, <i>ladrones</i>, and creatures of
low blood, fathered by evil Americanos and the nameless
women of towns.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Sonora we would whip them from our door,
but the sheepmen make much of their herders, calling
them brothers and <i>cu&ntilde;ados</i> and what not, to make
them stay, since the work is hard and dangerous.
And to every one of them, whether herder or camp
rustler, the owners give a rifle with ammunition, and
a revolver to carry always. So they are drunk with
valor. But our Jeff here has no fear of them, no, nor
decent respect. He overrides them when the fit is on
him, as if they were unfanged serpents&ndash;&ndash;and so far
he has escaped.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man leaned closer, and lowered his voice to
a hoarse whisper, acting out his words dramatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;But some day&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he clasped his heart, closed his
eyes, and seemed to lurch before a bullet. &#8220;No?&#8221; he
inquired, softly. &#8220;Ah, well, then, you must watch
over him, for he is a good man, doing many friendships,
and his father was a <i>buen hombre</i>, too, in the
days when we all were rich. So look after him&ndash;&ndash;for
an old man,&#8221; he added, and trudged wearily back to
the house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>HIDDEN WATER</h3>
</div>
<p>The trail to Hidden Water leads up the Salagua,
alternately climbing the hard mesa and losing
itself in the shifting sand of the river bottom until, a
mile or two below the mouth of the box ca&ntilde;on, it
swings in to the edge of the water. But the Salagua
is no purling brook, dignified by a bigger name; it is
not even a succession of mill ponds like the dammed-up
streams of the East: in its own name the Salagua
is a <i>Rio</i>, broad and swift, with a current that clutches
treacherously at a horse&#8217;s legs and roars over the
brink of stony reefs in a long, fretful line of rapids.
At the head of a broad mill race, where the yellow
flood waters boiled sullenly before they took their
plunge, Creede pulled up and surveyed the river
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swim?&#8221; he inquired, and when Hardy nodded he
shrugged his shoulders and turned his horse into the
water. &#8220;Keep your head upstream, then,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll try it a whirl, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Head to tail the two horses plodded heavily across
the ford, feeling their way among the submerged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
bowlders, while twenty feet below them the irresistible
onrush of the current slipped smoothly over the rim,
sending up a roar like the thunder of breakers. As
they struggled up the opposite bank after a final
slump into a narrow ditch Creede looked back and
laughed merrily at his bedraggled companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that for high?&#8221; he inquired, slapping his
wet legs. &#8220;I tell you, the old Salagua is a hell-roarer
when she gits started. I wouldn&#8217;t cross there this
afternoon for a hundred dollars. She&#8217;s away up
since we took the wagon over last night, but about to-morrow
you&#8217;ll hear her talk&ndash;&ndash;snow&#8217;s meltin&#8217; on the
mountains. I wish to God she&#8217;d <i>stay</i> up!&#8221; he added
fervently, as he poured the water out of his boots.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Hardy innocently. &#8220;Won&#8217;t it interfere
with your bringing in supplies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; said Creede, and then he laughed
maliciously. &#8220;But when you&#8217;ve been up here a
while,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;you&#8217;ll savvy a lot of things that
look kinder curious. If the old river would git up on
its hind legs and walk, forty feet high, and stay there
f&#8217;r a month, we cowmen would simply laugh ourselves
to death. We don&#8217;t give a dam&#8217; for supplies
as long as it keeps the sheep out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Begin to see light, eh?&#8221; he queried, as he pushed
on up the river. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the only thing in
God&#8217;s world that wasn&#8217;t made to order for these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
sheepmen; the old Salagua cuts right square across
the country east and west without consultin&#8217; nobody,
not even Jim Swope, and the sheep move north and
south.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you like to have the job of crossing a hundred
thousand <i>borregos</i> and half of &#8217;em with lambs,
when the <i>rio</i> was on a bender? I&#8217;ve seen some of
these sheepmen wadin&#8217; around up to their chins for
two weeks, tryin&#8217; to float twenty-five hundred head
across the river&ndash;&ndash;and there wasn&#8217;t turkey buzzards
enough in the country when they got through.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year they had the sand bars up around Hidden
Water lined with carcasses two deep where they&#8217;d
jest naturally crowded &#8217;em into the river and let &#8217;em
sink or swim. Them Chihuahua Mexicans, you
savvy. After they&#8217;d wore out their shoes and froze
their marrow-bones wadin&#8217; they got tired and shoved
&#8217;em in, regardless. Well, if this warm weather holds
we&#8217;ll be able to git our <i>rod&eacute;r</i> good and started before
the sheep come in. That&#8217;s one reason why I never
was able to do much with these sheepmen,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;They hit me right square in the middle of the round-up,
Spring and Fall, when I&#8217;m too busy gatherin&#8217;
cattle to pay much attention to &#8217;em. I did plan a
little surprise party last year&ndash;&ndash;but that was somethin&#8217;
special. But now you&#8217;re on the job, Rufe,&#8221; he continued
reassuringly, &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to leave all sheep and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
sheepmen strictly alone&ndash;&ndash;you can bank on that.
Bein&#8217; as we are goin&#8217; to try the expeeriment I want
to see it done right. I never made a cent fightin&#8217;
&#8217;em, that&#8217;s a cinch, and if you can appeal to their
better natures, w&#8217;y, go to it! I&#8217;d help you if I could,
but bein&#8217; as I can&#8217;t I&#8217;ll git out of the road and give
you a chanst.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll tell you how it&#8217;ll be,&#8221; he continued,
turning in his saddle and hooking one leg over the
horn, &#8220;the boys&#8217;ll come in for the <i>rod&eacute;r</i> to-morrow or
next day; we begin to gather on the first, and it takes
us about a month. Well, we look for the sheep to
come in on us at about the same time&ndash;&ndash;first of April&ndash;&ndash;and
we ain&#8217;t been fooled yet. They&#8217;ll begin to stack
up on the other side any time now, and as soon
as the water goes down they&#8217;ll come across with
a rush. And if they&#8217;re feelin&#8217; good-natured they&#8217;ll
spread out over The Rolls and drift north, but
if they&#8217;re feelin&#8217; bad they&#8217;ll sneak up onto Bronco
Mesa and scatter the cattle forty ways for Sunday,
and bust up my <i>rod&eacute;r</i> and raise hell generally.
We had a little trouble over that last year,&#8221;
he added parenthetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll turn over the house and the grub and
the whole business to you this year and camp out with
the boys under the mesquite&ndash;&ndash;and then you can entertain
them sheepmen and jolly &#8217;em up no end. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
won&#8217;t have a dam&#8217; thing&ndash;&ndash;horse feed, grub, tobacco,
matches, nothin&#8217;! Never do have anythin&#8217;. I&#8217;d
rather have a bunch of Apaches camped next to me&ndash;&ndash;but
if you want to be good to &#8217;em there&#8217;s your chanst.
Meanwhile, I&#8217;m only a cow-punch pullin&#8217; off a round-up,
and your name is Mr.&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re the superintendent
of the Dos S. Your job is to protect the upper
range, and I begin to think you can do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a tone of half-hearted enthusiasm about
this talk which marked it for a prepared &#8220;spiel,&#8221;
laboriously devised to speed the new superintendent
upon his way; but, not being schooled in social deceit,
Creede failed utterly in making it convincing.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; said Hardy, &#8220;but tell me&ndash;&ndash;what
has been your custom in the past? Haven&#8217;t you been
in the habit of feeding them when they came in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Feed &#8217;em?&#8221; cried Creede, flaring up suddenly.
&#8220;Did I feed &#8217;em? Well, I should guess yes&ndash;&ndash;I never
turned one away hungry in my life. W&#8217;y, hell, man,&#8221;
he exclaimed, his anger growing on him, &#8220;I slep&#8217; in
the same blanket with &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;until I become lousy,&#8221; he
added grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Hardy, aghast. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
mean to say&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; interrupted Creede ironically, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean
to say anythin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;not from now on. But while we&#8217;re
on the subject and to avoid any future misunderstandin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
I might just as well tell you right now that I
can&#8217;t see nothin&#8217; good in a sheepman&ndash;&ndash;<i>nothin&#8217;!</i> I&#8217;m
like my cat Tom when he sees a rattlesnake, my hair
bushes up clean over my ears and I see hell, damnation,
and sudden death!&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose up, frowning, on his mighty horse and
gazed at Hardy with eyes that burned deep with
passion. &#8220;If every sheep and sheepman in Arizona
should drop dead at this minute,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it would
simply give me a laughin&#8217; sensation. God damn
&#8217;em!&#8221; he added passionately, and it sounded like a
prayer.</p>
<p>Half an hour later as they passed through the
gloomy silence of the box ca&ntilde;on, picking their way
over rocks and bowlders and driftwood cast forty feet
above the river level in some terrific glut of waters,
he began to talk again, evenly and quietly, pointing
out indifferent things along the trail, and when at last
they mounted the hill and looked down upon Hidden
Water his anger was forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he remarked, throwing out a hand,
&#8220;there&#8217;s home&ndash;&ndash;how do you like it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardy paused and looked it over critically&ndash;&ndash;a
broad V-shaped valley half a mile in length, beginning
at the mouth of a great dry wash and spreading
out through trees and hummocks down to the river.
A broken row of cottonwoods and sycamores stretched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
along the farther side, following the broad, twisting
bed of the sand wash where the last flood had
ripped its way to the Salagua; and on the opposite
side, close up against the base of the cliff, a flash of
white walls and the shadow of a <i>ramada</i> showed where
man had built his puny dwelling high in order to
escape its fury. At their feet lay the ranch pasture,
a broad elbow of the valley rich with grass and
mesquite trees and fenced in with barbed wire that ran
from cliff to cliff. Beyond the eastern wall the
ground was rough and broken, cut up by innumerable
gulches and waterways, and above its ridges there
rose the forbidding crags of a black butte whose
shoulders ran down to and confined the silvery river.
Across the river and to the south the land was even
rougher, rising in sheer precipices, above the crests of
which towered a mighty needle of rock, standing out
against the sky like a cathedral spire, yet of a greater
dignity and magnificence&ndash;&ndash;purple with the regal robes
of distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Weaver&#8217;s Needle,&#8221; volunteered Creede,
following his companion&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Every lost mine for
a hundred miles around here is located by sightin&#8217; at
that peak. The feller it&#8217;s named after was picked up
by the Apaches while he was out lookin&#8217; for the Lost
Dutchman and there&#8217;s been a Jonah on the hidden-treasure
business ever since, judgin&#8217; by the results.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye see that big butte straight ahead? That&#8217;s
Black Butte. She&#8217;s so rough that even the mountain
sheep git sore-footed, so they say&ndash;&ndash;we have to go up
there on foot and drive our cattle down with rocks.
Old Bill Johnson&#8217;s place is over the other side of that
far butte; he&#8217;s got a fine rich valley over there&ndash;&ndash;the
sheep haven&#8217;t got in on him yet. You remember that
old feller that was drunk down at Bender&ndash;&ndash;well,
that&#8217;s Bill. Calls his place Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket; you
wait till you try to git in there some day and you&#8217;ll
know why.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and turned to the north.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might as well give you the lay of the land,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be too busy to talk for the next month.
There&#8217;s the Four Peaks, northeast of us, and our
cows run clean to the rocks. They&#8217;s more different
brands in that forty miles than you saw in the whole
Cherrycow country, I bet ye. I&#8217;ve got five myself
on a couple hundred head that the old man left me&ndash;&ndash;and
everybody else the same way. You see, when
the sheep come in down on the desert and around
Moreno&#8217;s we kept pushin&#8217; what was left of our
cattle east and east until we struck the Peaks&ndash;&ndash;and
here we are, in a corner. The old judge
has got nigh onto two thousand head, but they&#8217;s about
twenty of us poor devils livin&#8217; up here in the rocks that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
has got enough irons and ear marks to fill a brand
book, and not a thousand head among us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I started out to show you the country,
didn&#8217;t I? You see that bluff back of the house down
there? That runs from here clean to the Four Peaks
without a break, and then it swings west in a kind of
an ox bow and makes that long ridge up there to the
north that we called the Juate. All that high country
between our house here and the Peaks&ndash;&ndash;everythin&#8217;
east of that long bluff&ndash;&ndash;is Bronco Mesa.
That&#8217;s the upper range the judge asked me to point
out to you. Everythin&#8217; west of Bronco Mesa is The
Rolls&ndash;&ndash;all them rollin&#8217; hills out there&ndash;&ndash;and they&#8217;s
feed enough out there to keep all the sheep in the
country, twice over&ndash;&ndash;but no water. Now what
makes us cowmen hot is, after we&#8217;ve give &#8217;em
that country and welcome, the sheepmen&#8217;re all
the time tryin&#8217; to sneak in on our upper range.
Our cows can&#8217;t hardly make a livin&#8217; walkin&#8217; ten or
fifteen miles out on The Rolls every day, and then
back again to water; but them dam&#8217; sheep can go a
week without drinkin&#8217;, and as much as a month in
the winter-time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t they give us a chanst, then? We <i>give</i>
&#8217;em all the good level land and simply ask &#8217;em as a
favor to please keep off of the bench up there and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
leave our cows what little cactus and browse they is.
But no&ndash;&ndash;seems like as soon as you give one of them
Chihuahua Mexicans a gun he wants to git a fight
out of somebody, and so they come crowdin&#8217; in across
our dead line, just to see if they can&#8217;t git some of us
goin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more his eyes were burning, his breath came
hard, and his voice became high and sustained.
&#8220;Well, I give one of &#8217;em all he wanted,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
more. I took his dam&#8217; pistol away and beat him over
the head with it&ndash;&ndash;and I <i>moved</i> him, too. He was
Jasper Swope&#8217;s pet, and I reckon he had his orders,
but I noticed the rest went round.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly and sat silent, twisting his
horse&#8217;s mane uneasily. Then he looked up, smiling
curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t come up this year I would&#8217;ve killed
some of them fellers,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;I&#8217;m gittin&#8217;
as crazy as old Bill Johnson&ndash;&ndash;and he hears voices.
But now lookee here, Rufe, you don&#8217;t want to believe
a word I say about this trouble. Don&#8217;t you pay any
attention to me; I&#8217;m bughouse, and I know it. Jest
don&#8217;t mention sheep to me and I&#8217;ll be as happy as an
Injun on a mescal jag. Come on, I&#8217;ll run you to the
house!&#8221;</p>
<p>Throwing his weight forward he jumped his big
horse down the rocky trail and went thundering across
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
the flat, whooping and laughing and swinging under
mesquite trees as if his whole heart was in the race.
Catching the contagion Hardy&#8217;s sorrel dashed
madly after him, and the moment they struck the
open he went by like a shot, over-running the goal
and dancing around the low adobe house like a
circus horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Joe,&#8221; exclaimed Creede as he came up, &#8220;that
<i>caballo</i> of yours can run some. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to make a
little easy money off of Bill Lightfoot when he comes
in. He&#8217;s been blowin&#8217; about that gray of his for two
years now and I&#8217;ll match you ag&#8217;inst him for a
yearlin&#8217;. And don&#8217;t you forgit, boy, we&#8217;re going
after that black stallion up on Bronco Mesa just as
soon as the <i>rod&eacute;r</i> is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>His face was all aglow with friendliness and enthusiasm
now, but as they started toward the house,
after turning their horses into the corral, he suddenly
stopped short in the trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I wonder what&#8217;s keepin&#8217; Tom?
Here Tom! Heere Tom! Pussy, pussy, pussy!&#8221; He
listened, and called again. &#8220;I hope the coyotes ain&#8217;t
caught him while I was gone,&#8221; he said at length.
&#8220;They treed him a few times last year, but he just
stayed up there and yelled until I came&ndash;&ndash;spoiled his
voice callin&#8217; so long, but you bet he can purr, all
right.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>He listened once more, long and anxiously, then
his face lit up suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear that?&#8221; he asked, motioning toward the bluff,
and while Hardy was straining his ears a stunted
black cat with a crook in his tail came into view, racing
in wildly from the great pile of fallen bowlders
that lay at the base of the cliff, and yowling in a
hoarse, despairing voice, like a condemned kitten in a
sack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy!&#8221; cried Creede,
and as the cat stopped abruptly, blinking warily at
Hardy, he strode forward and gathered it gently into
his arms. &#8220;Well, you poor little devil,&#8221; he exclaimed,
stroking its rough coat tenderly, &#8220;you&#8217;re all chawed
up again! Did them dam&#8217; coyotes try to git you while
I was gone?&#8221; And with many profane words of endearment
he hugged it against his breast, unashamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the gamiest cat in Arizona,&#8221; he said,
bringing him over to Hardy with conscious pride.
&#8220;Whoa, kitten, he won&#8217;t hurt you. Dogged if he
won&#8217;t tackle a rattlesnake, and kill &#8217;im, too. I used
to be afraid to git out of bed at night without puttin&#8217;
on my boots, but if any old rattler crawls under my
cot now it&#8217;s good-bye, Mr. Snake. Tommy is right
there with the goods&ndash;&ndash;and he ain&#8217;t been bit yet,
neither. He killed three side-winders last Summer&ndash;&ndash;didn&#8217;t
you, Tom, Old Socks?&ndash;&ndash;and if any sheep-herder&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
dog comes snoopin&#8217; around the back door
he&#8217;ll mount him in a minute. If a man was as brave
as he is, now, he&#8217;d&ndash;&ndash;well, that&#8217;s the trouble&ndash;&ndash;he
wouldn&#8217;t last very long in this country. I used to
wonder sometimes which&#8217;d go first&ndash;&ndash;me or Tom.
The sheepmen was after me, and their dogs was after
Tom. But I&#8217;m afraid poor Tommy is elected; this is
a dam&#8217; bad country for cats.&#8221;</p>
<p>He set him down with a glance of admiring solicitude,
such as a Spartan mother might have bestowed
upon her fighting offspring, and kicked open the unlocked
door.</p>
<p>The Dos S ranch house was a long, low structure
of adobe bricks, divided in the middle by the open
passageway which the Mexicans always affect to encourage
any vagrant breeze. On one side of the
<i>corredor</i> was a single large room, half storehouse,
half bunk room, with a litter of pack saddles, rawhide
kyacks and leather in one corner, a heap
of baled hay, grain, and provisions in the other,
and the rest strewn with the general wreckage of a
camp&ndash;&ndash;cooking utensils, Dutch ovens, canvas pack
covers, worn-out saddles, and ropes. On the other
side the rooms were more pretentious, one of them
even having a board floor. First came the large
living-room with a stone chimney and a raised
hearth before the fireplace; whereon, each on its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
separate pile of ashes, reposed two Dutch ovens, a
bean kettle, and a frying-pan, with a sawed-off shovel
in the corner for scooping up coals. Opening into
the living-room were two bedrooms, which, upon exploration,
turned out to be marvellously fitted up, with
high-headed beds, bureaus and whatnots, besides a
solid oak desk.</p>
<p>To these explorations of Hardy&#8217;s Creede paid but
slight attention, he being engaged in cooking a hurried
meal and watching Tommy, who had a bad habit
of leaping up on the table and stealing; but as Hardy
paused by the desk in the front bedroom he looked up
from mixing his bread and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your room, Rufe, so you can clean it up
and move in. I generally sleep outdoors myself&ndash;&ndash;and
I ain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217;, nohow. Jest put them guns
and traps into the other room, so I can find &#8217;em. Aw,
go ahead, you&#8217;ll need that desk to keep your papers
in. You&#8217;ve got to write all the letters and keep the
accounts, anyhow. It always did make my back ache
to lean over that old desk, and I&#8217;m glad to git shent
of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty swell rooms, ain&#8217;t they? Notice them lace
curtains? The kangaroo rats have chawed the ends
a little, but I tell you, when Susie and Sallie Winship
was here this was the finest house for forty miles.
That used to be Sallie&#8217;s room, where you are now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
Many&#8217;s the time in the old days that I&#8217;ve rid up here
to make eyes at Sallie, but the old lady wouldn&#8217;t
stand for no sich foolishness. Old Winship married
her back in St. Louie and brought her out here to
slave around cookin&#8217; for <i>rod&eacute;r</i> hands, and she wanted
her daughters to live different. Nope, she didn&#8217;t
want no bow-legged cow-punch for a son-in-law, and I
don&#8217;t blame her none, because this ain&#8217;t no place for a
woman; but Sal was a mighty fine girl, all the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook a little flour over his dough, brushed the
cat off the table absently, and began pinching biscuits
into the sizzling fat of the Dutch oven, which smoked
over its bed of coals on the hearth. Then, hooking the
red-hot cover off the fire, he slapped it on and piled
a little row of coals along the upturned rim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you never hear about the Winship girls?&#8221;
he asked, stroking the cat with his floury hands.
&#8220;No? Well, it was on account of them that the judge
took over this ranch. Old man Winship was one of
these old-time Indian-fightin&#8217;, poker-playin&#8217; sports
that come pretty nigh havin&#8217; their own way about
everythin&#8217;. He had a fine ranch up here&ndash;&ndash;the old Dos
S used to brand a thousand calves and more, every
round-up; but when he got old he kinder speculated in
mines and loaned money, and got in the hole generally,
and about the time the sheep drifted in on him
he hauled off and died. I pulled off a big <i>rod&eacute;r</i> for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
&#8217;em and they sold a lot of cattle tryin&#8217; to patch
things up the best they could, but jest as everythin&#8217;
was lovely the drouth struck &#8217;em all in a
heap, and when the Widde&#8217; Winship got the estate
settled up she didn&#8217;t have nothin&#8217; much left but
cows and good will. She couldn&#8217;t sell the cows&ndash;&ndash;you
never can, right after these dry spells&ndash;&ndash;and as I said,
she wouldn&#8217;t let the girls marry any of us cowmen
to kinder be man for the outfit; so what does she do
but run the ranch herself!</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir&ndash;&ndash;Susie and Sallie, that was as nice and
eddicated girls as you ever see, they jest put on
overalls and climbed their horses and worked them
cattle themselves. Course they had <i>rod&eacute;r</i> hands to
do the dirty work in the corrals&ndash;&ndash;brandin&#8217; and ear-markin&#8217;
and the like&ndash;&ndash;but for ridin&#8217; the range and
drivin&#8217; they was as good as the best. Well, sir, you&#8217;d
think every man in Arizona, when he heard what they
was doin&#8217;, would do everythin&#8217; in his power to help
&#8217;em along, even to runnin&#8217; a Dos S on an <i>orehanna</i>
once in a while instead of hoggin&#8217; it himself; but they&#8217;s
fellers in this world, I&#8217;m convinced, that would steal
milk from a sick baby!&#8221;</p>
<p>The brawny foreman of the Dos S dropped the cat
and threw out his hands impressively, and once more
the wild glow crept back into his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember that Jim Swope that I introduced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
you to down on the desert? Well, he&#8217;s a good sheepman,
but he&#8217;s on the grab for money like a wolf.
He&#8217;s got it, too&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s the hell of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Creede sighed, and threw a scrap of bacon to
Tommy.</p>
<p>&#8220;He keeps a big store down at Moroni,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;and the widde&#8217;, not wantin&#8217; to shove her cows
onto a fallin&#8217; market, runs up an account with him&ndash;&ndash;somethin&#8217;
like a thousand dollars&ndash;&ndash;givin&#8217; her note for
it, of course. It&#8217;s about four years ago, now, that
she happened to be down in Moroni when court was
in session, when she finds out by accident that this
same Jim Swope, seein&#8217; that cattle was about to go
up, is goin&#8217; to close her out. He&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; done it, too,
like fallin&#8217; off a log, if the old judge hadn&#8217;t happened
to be in town lookin&#8217; up some lawsuit.
When he heard about it he was so durned mad he
wrote out a check for a thousand dollars and give it
to her; and then, when she told him all her troubles,
he up and bought the whole ranch at her own price&ndash;&ndash;it
wasn&#8217;t much&ndash;&ndash;and shipped her and the girls back to
St. Louie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Creede brushed the dirt and flour off the table with
a greasy rag and dumped the biscuits out of the oven.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there&#8217;s where I lost my last
chanst to git a girl. Come on and eat.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE CROSSING</h3>
</div>
<p>From lonely ranches along the Salagua and
Verde, from the Sunflower and up the Alamo,
from all the sheeped-out and desolate Four Peaks
country the cowboys drifted in to Hidden Water for
the round-up, driving their extra mounts before them.
Beneath the brush <i>ramada</i> of the ranch house they
threw off their canvas-covered beds and turned their
pack horses out to roll, strapping bells and hobbles on
the bad ones, and in a day the deserted valley of Agua
Escondida became alive with great preparations.
A posse of men on fresh mounts rode out on Bronco
Mesa, following with unerring instinct the trail of the
Dos S horses, balking their wild breaks for freedom
and rushing them headlong into the fenced pasture
across the creek. As the hired hands of the Dos S
outfit caught up their mounts and endeavored to put
the fear of God into their hearts, the mountain boys
got out the keg of horseshoes and began to shoe&ndash;&ndash;every
man his own blacksmith.</p>
<p>It was rough work, all around, whether blinding
and topping off the half-wild ponies or throwing them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
and tacking cold-wrought &#8220;cowboy&#8221; shoes to their
flint-like feet, and more than one enthusiast came
away limping or picking the loose skin from a
bruised hand. Yet through it all the dominant note
of dare-devil hilarity never failed. The solitude of
the ranch, long endured, had left its ugly mark
on all of them. They were starved for company
and excitement; obsessed by strange ideas which
they had evolved out of the tumuli of their past
experience and clung to with dogged tenacity; warped
with egotism; stubborn, boastful, or silent, as their
humor took them, but now all eager to break the
shell and mingle in the rush of life.</p>
<p>In this riot of individuals Jefferson Creede, the
round-up boss, strode about like a king, untrammelled
and unafraid. There was not a ridge or valley in
all the Four Peaks country that he did not know,
yet it was not for this that he was boss; there was
not a virtue or weakness in all that crowd that he
was not cognizant of, in the back of his scheming
brain. The men that could rope, the men that could
ride, the quitters, the blowhards, the rattleheads, the
lazy, the crooked, the slow-witted&ndash;&ndash;all were on his
map of the country; and as, when he rode the ridges,
he memorized each gulch and tree and odd rock, so
about camp he tried out his puppets, one by one, to
keep his map complete.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>As they gathered about the fire that evening it
was Bill Lightfoot who engaged his portentous interest.
He listened to Bill&#8217;s boastful remarks
critically, cocking his head to one side and smiling
whenever he mentioned his horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; asserted Bill belligerently, &#8220;I mean it&ndash;&ndash;that
gray of mine can skin anything in the country,
for a hundred yards or a mile. I&#8217;ve got money that
says so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, bull!&#8221; exclaimed Creede scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bull, nothin&#8217;,&#8221; retorted Lightfoot hotly. &#8220;I bet
ye&ndash;&ndash;I bet ye a thousand dollars they ain&#8217;t a horse in
Arizona that can keep out of my dust for a quarter!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I know you ain&#8217;t got no thousand dollars&ndash;&ndash;ner
ten,&#8221; sneered Creede. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you bet
yearlings? If you&#8217;d blow some of that hot air
through a tube it&#8217;d melt rocks, I reckon. But talk
cow, man; we can all savvy that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, where&#8217;s the horse that can beat me?&#8221; demanded
Lightfoot, bristling.</p>
<p>&#8220;That little sorrel out in the pasture,&#8221; answered
Creede laconically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet ye!&#8221; blustered Lightfoot. &#8220;Aw, rats!
He ain&#8217;t even broke yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can run, all right. I&#8217;ll go you for a yearling
heifer. Put up or shut up.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>And so the race was run. Early in the morning
the whole <i>rod&eacute;o</i> outfit adjourned to the <i>parada</i>
ground out by the pole corrals, the open spot where
they work over the cattle. Hardy danced his sorrel
up to the line where the gray was waiting, there was
a scamper of feet, a streak of dust, and Bill Lightfoot
was out one yearling heifer. A howling mob of
cowboys pursued them from the scratch, racing each
other to the finish, and then in a yell of laughter at
Bill Lightfoot they capered up the ca&ntilde;on and spread
out over The Rolls&ndash;&ndash;the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> had begun.</p>
<p>As the shadow of the great red butte to the west,
around which the wagon road toiled for so many
weary miles, reached out and touched the valley,
they came back in a body, hustling a bunch of cattle
along before them. And such cattle! After his year
with the Chiricahua outfit in that blessed eastern
valley where no sheep as yet had ever strayed Hardy
was startled by their appearance. Gaunt, rough,
stunted, with sharp hips and hollow flanks and bellies
swollen from eating the unprofitable browse of cactus
and bitter shrubs, they nevertheless sprinted along
on their wiry legs like mountain bucks; and a peculiar
wild, haggard stare, stamped upon the faces of the
old cows, showed its replica even in the twos and yearlings.
Yet he forbore to ask Creede the question
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
which arose involuntarily to his lips, for he knew the
inevitable answer.</p>
<p>Day after day, as they hurriedly combed The
Rolls for what few cattle remained on the lower
range, the cowmen turned their eyes to the river and
to the ca&ntilde;ons and towering cliffs beyond, for the
sheep; until at last as they sat by the evening fire
Creede pointed silently to the lambent flame of a
camp fire, glowing like a torch against the southern
sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s your friends, Rufe,&#8221; he said, and the
cowmen glanced at Hardy inquiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might as well tell you fellers,&#8221; Creede continued,
&#8220;that one reason Rufe come up here was to
see if he couldn&#8217;t do somethin&#8217; with these sheepmen.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and looked at the circle of faces with
a smile that was almost a sneer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellers wouldn&#8217;t back me up when it come
to fightin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;none except Ben Reavis and the Clark
boys&ndash;&ndash;so I told the old judge we might as well lay
down, and to send up some smooth <i>hombre</i> to try
and jockey &#8217;em a little. Well, Hardy&#8217;s the <i>hombre</i>;
and bein&#8217; as you fellers won&#8217;t fight, you might as
well look pleasant about it. What&#8217;s that you say,
Bill?&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned with a sardonic grin to Lightfoot, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
had already been reduced to a state of silence by the
relentless persecutions of the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> boss.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never said nawthin&#8217;,&#8221; replied Lightfoot sullenly.
&#8220;But if you&#8217;d&#8217;ve gone at &#8217;em the way we
wanted to,&#8221; he blurted out, as the grin broadened,
&#8220;instead of tryin&#8217; to move the whole outfit by daylight,
I&#8217;d&#8217;ve stayed with you till hell froze over. I
don&#8217;t want to git sent up fer ten years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Creede coolly, &#8220;ner you never will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t see what you&#8217;re pickin&#8217; on me fer,&#8221;
bellowed Lightfoot, &#8220;the other fellers was there too.
Why don&#8217;t you sass Ensign or Pete a while?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For a durned good reason,&#8221; replied Creede
steadily. &#8220;They never <i>was</i> for fightin&#8217;, but you,
with that yawp of yours, was always a-hollerin&#8217; and
ribbin&#8217; me on to fight, and then, when the time come,
you never said &#8216;Boo!&#8217; at &#8217;em. Tucked your young
cannon into the seat of your pants and flew, dam&#8217;
ye, and that&#8217;s all there was to it. But that&#8217;s all
right,&#8221; he added resignedly. &#8220;If you fellers don&#8217;t
want to fight you don&#8217;t have to. But, dam&#8217; it, keep
shut about it now, until you mean business.&#8221;</p>
<p>As to just who this man Hardy was and what he
proposed to do with the sheep the members of the
Four Peaks round-up were still in ignorance. All
they knew was that he could ride, even when it came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
to drifting his horse over the rocky ridges, and that
Jeff Creede took him as a matter of course. But,
for a superintendent, he never seemed to have much
to say for himself. It was only when he walked
up to his sorrel pony in that gentle, precise way he
had, and went through the familiar motions of climbing
a &#8220;bad one&#8221; that they sensed, dimly, a past not
without experience and excitement. Even in the
preoccupation of their own affairs and doings they
could not fail to notice a supple strength in his white
hands, a military precision in his movements, and
above all a look in his eyes when he became excited&ndash;&ndash;the
steady resolute stare with which his militant father
had subdued outlaw horses, buck soldiers, and
Apaches, even his own son, when all had not gone well.
It was this which had inspired Bill Lightfoot to
restrain his tongue when he was sore over his defeat;
and even though Hardy confessed to being a
rider, somehow no one ever thought of sawing off
Spike Kennedy&#8217;s &#8220;side winder&#8221; on him. The quiet,
brooding reserve which came from his soldier life
protected him from such familiar jests, and without
knowing why, the men of the Four Peaks looked
up to him.</p>
<p>Even after his mission was announced, Hardy
made no change in his manner of life. He rode out
each day on the round-up, conning the lay of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
land; at the corral he sat on the fence and kept tally,
frankly admitting that he could neither rope nor
brand; in camp he did his share of the cooking and
said little, listening attentively to the random talk.
Only when sheep were mentioned did he show a
marked interest, and even then it was noticed that he
made no comment, whatever his thoughts were.
But if he told no one what he was going to do, it
was not entirely due to an overrated reticence, for he
did not know himself. Not a man there but had run
the gamut of human emotions in trying to protect his
ranch; they had driven herders off with guns; they
had cut their huddled bands at night and scattered
them for the coyotes; they had caught unwary Mexican
<i>borregueros</i> in forbidden pastures and administered
&#8220;shap lessons,&#8221; stretching them over bowlders
and spanking them with their leather leggings; they
had &#8220;talked reason&#8221; to the bosses in forceful terms;
they had requested them politely to move; they had
implored them with tears in their eyes&ndash;&ndash;and still like
a wave of the sea, like a wind, like a scourge of grasshoppers
which cannot be withstood, the sheep had
come on, always hungry, always fat, always more.</p>
<p>Nor was there any new thing in hospitality. The last
bacon and bread had been set upon the table; baled
hay and grain, hauled in by day&#8217;s works from the
alfalfa fields of Moroni and the Salagua, had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
fed to the famished horses of the very men who had
sheeped off the grass; the same blanket had been
shared, sometimes, alas, with men who were &#8220;crumby.&#8221;
And it was equally true that, in return, the beans and
meat of chance herders had been as ravenously devoured,
the water casks of patient &#8220;camp-rustlers&#8221;
had been drained midway between the river and camp,
and stray wethers had showed up in the round-up
fry-pans in the shape of mutton. Ponder as he would
upon the problem no solution offered itself to Hardy.
He had no policy, even, beyond that of common politeness;
and as the menacing clamor of the sheep drifted
up to them from the river the diplomat who was to
negotiate the great truce began to wonder whether,
after all, he was the man of the hour or merely another
college graduate gone wrong.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the river in bands of two
and three thousand the cohorts of the sheep gathered
to make the crossing&ndash;&ndash;gathered and waited, for the
Salagua was still high. At the foot of the high cliffs,
from the cleft ca&ntilde;on of which water flowed forth
as if some rod had called it from the rock, the leaders
of the sheepmen were sitting in council, gazing at
the powerful sweep of the level river, and then at the
distant sand bar where their charges must win the
shore or be swept into the whirlpool below. Ah,
that whirlpool! Many a frightened ewe and weakling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
lamb in years past had drifted helplessly into
its swirl and been sucked down, to come up below
the point a water-logged carcass. And for each
stinking corpse that littered the lower bar the boss
sheep owner subtracted five dollars from the sum
of his hard-earned wealth. Already on the flats below
them the willows and burro bushes were trembling
as eager teeth trimmed them of their leaves&ndash;&ndash;in a
day, or two days, the river bottom would be fed
bare; and behind and behind, clear to the broad floor
of the desert, band after band was pressing on to
the upper crossing of the Salagua.</p>
<p>As Hardy rode up over the rocky point against
which the river threw its full strength and then, flung
inexorably back, turned upon itself in a sullen
whirlpool, he could see the sheep among the willows,
the herders standing impassive, leaning upon their
guns as more rustic shepherds lean upon their staves,
and above, at the head of the crossing, the group of
men, sitting within the circle of their horses in anxious
conference. If any of them saw him, outlined
like a sentinel against the sky, they made no sign;
but suddenly a man in a high Texas hat leaped up
from the group, sprang astride his mule and spurred
him into the cold water. For the first twenty feet
the mule waded, shaking his ears; then he slumped off
the edge of a submerged bench into deeper water and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
swam, heading across the stream but drifting diagonally
with the current until, striking bottom
once more, he struggled out upon the sand spit. The
rider looked eagerly about, glanced up casually at
the man on the point below, and then plunged back
into the water, shouting out hoarse orders to his Mexicans,
who were smoking idly in the shade of overhanging
rocks. Immediately they scrambled to their
feet and scattered along the hillside. The stroke of
axes echoed from the crags above, and soon men came
staggering down to the river, dragging the thorny
limbs of <i>palo verdes</i> behind them. With these they
quickly constructed a brush fence in the form of a
wing, running parallel to the cliff and making a chute
which opened into the river.</p>
<p>Then with a great braying and bleating a huddle
of sheep moved unwillingly along it, led by bold
goats with crooked horns and resolute beards, and
pushed forward by that same reckless rider on his
black mule, assisted by a horde of shouting Mexicans.
But at the touch of the cold water, two days
from the snow beds of the White Mountains, even the
hardy bucks stepped back and shook their heads defiantly.
In vain with showers of rocks and flapping
tarpaulins the herders stormed the rear of the press&ndash;&ndash;every
foot was set against them and the sheep only
rushed about along the edge of the herd or crowded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
in close-wedged masses against the bluff. At last
a line of men leaped into the enclosure, holding up
a long canvas wagon-cover and, encircling the first
section of the leaders, shoved them by main force into
the river.</p>
<p>Instantly the goats took water, swimming free,
and below them the man on the black mule shouted
and waved his broad Texas hat, heading them across
the stream. But the timid sheep turned back behind
him, landing below the fence against all opposition,
and the babel of their braying rose higher and higher,
as if in protest against their unlucky fate. Again
and again the herders, stripped to their underclothes,
pushed the unwilling sheep into the current, wading
out to their chins to keep them headed across; each
time the sodden creatures evaded them and, drifting
with the current, landed far below on the same side,
whence they rushed back to join their fellows.</p>
<p>Upon the opposite shore the goats stood shivering,
watching the struggle with yellow, staring eyes which
showed no trace of fear. Like brave generals of
a craven band they were alone in their hardihood and,
with their feet upon the promised land, were doomed
either to proceed alone or return to their companions.
So at last they did, plunging in suddenly, while the
man on the mule spurred in below in a vain effort to
turn them back.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></div>
<p>That night by the camp fire Hardy mentioned the
man on a black mule.</p>
<p>&#8220;My old friend, Jasp Swope,&#8221; explained Creede
suavely, &#8220;brother of Jim, the feller I introduced you
to. Sure, Jasp and I have had lo-ong talks together&ndash;&ndash;but
he don&#8217;t like me any more.&#8221; He twisted his
nose and made a face, as if to intimate that it was
merely a childish squabble, and Hardy said no more.
He was growing wise.</p>
<p>The next morning, and the next, Jasper Swope
made other attempts at the crossing; and then, as
the snow water from the high mountains slipped
by and the warm weather dried up by so much each
little stream, he was able at last to ford the diminished
river. But first, with that indomitable energy
which marked him at every move, he cleared a passage
along the base of the cliff to a place where the earth-covered
moraine broke off at the edge of the water.
Here a broad ledge shot down to the river like a
toboggan slide, with a six-foot jump off at the
bottom.</p>
<p>Once on this chute, with the strong tug of the
canvas wagon-covers behind, there was nothing for
the sheep to do but to take the plunge, and as his
brawny herders tumbled them head over heels into
the deep current Swope and his helpers waded out
in a line below, shunting each ewe and wading toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
the farther shore. There on the edge of the sand
spit they huddled in a bunch, gathering about the
hardier bucks and serving as a lure for those that
followed. As cut after cut was forced into the stream
a long row of bobbing heads stretched clear across the
river, each animal striving desperately to gain the
opposite bank and landing, spent and puffing, far
below. A Mexican boy at intervals drove these strays
up the shore to the big bunch and then concealed
himself in the bushes lest by his presence he turn some
timid swimmer back and the whirlpool increase its
toll. So they crossed them in two herds, the wethers
first, and then the ewes and lambs&ndash;&ndash;and all the little
lambs that could not stem the stream were floated
across in broad pieces of tarpaulin whose edges were
held up by wading men.</p>
<p>From Lookout Point it was a majestic spectacle,
the high cliffs, the silvery river gliding noiselessly
out from its black ca&ntilde;on, the white masses of sheep,
clustering on either side of the water&ndash;&ndash;and as the
work went ahead merrily the Mexicans, their naked
bodies gleaming like polished bronze in the ardent
sun, broke into a wild refrain, a love song, perhaps,
or a <i>cancion</i> of old Mexico. Working side by side
with his men Jasper Swope joined in the song himself,
and as they returned empty-handed he seized the
tallest and strongest of them and ducked him in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
water while his retainers roared with laughter. And
Hardy, sitting unnoticed upon his horse, began to
understand why these low-browed barbarians from
Mexico were willing to fight, and if need be to
die, for their masters. The age of feudalism had
returned&ndash;&ndash;the lords of the sheep went forth like barons,
sharing every hardship and leading the way in
danger, and their men followed with the same unthinking
devotion that the Myrmidons showed for
noble Achilles or the Crusaders for their white-crossed
knights.</p>
<p>Upon this and many other feats Hardy had ample
leisure to meditate, for the sheepmen regarded him
no more than if he had been a monument placed high
upon the point to give witness to their victory. As
the sheep crossed they were even allowed to straggle
out along the slopes of the forbidden mesa, untended
by their shepherds; and if the upper range was the
special reserve of the cowmen the sheep owners showed
no knowledge of the fact. For two days the grazing
herd crept slowly along the mesquite-covered flat toward
Lookout Point, and on the third morning they
boiled up over the rocks and spewed down into the
valley of the Alamo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; observed Creede, as he watched the slow
creeping of the flock, &#8220;here&#8217;s where I have to quit
you, Rufe. In a week this ground around here will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
be as level as a billiard table and they won&#8217;t be
enough horse feed in the valley to keep a burro.
The town herd pulls out for Bender this mornin&#8217; and
the rest of us will move up to Carrizo Creek.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hurried away to oversee the packing, but when
all was ready he waved the boys ahead and returned
to the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I was sayin&#8217; a while ago, you won&#8217;t see nothin&#8217;
but sheep around here now for the next two weeks&ndash;&ndash;and
all I want to say is, keep &#8217;em out of the pasture,
and f&#8217;r God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t let &#8217;em corral in the brandin&#8217;
pens! They&#8217;re dirty enough already, but if you git
about six inches of sheep manure in there and then
mill a few hundred head of cattle around on top
of it, the dust would choke a skunk. Our cows ain&#8217;t
so over-particular about that sheep smell, but if
we poor cowboys has got to breathe sheep and eat
sheep and spit up sheep every time we brand, it&#8217;s
crowdin&#8217; hospitality pretty strong. But if they want
grub or clothes or tabac, go to it&ndash;&ndash;and see if you can&#8217;t
keep &#8217;em off the upper range.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and gazed at Hardy with eyes which
suggested a world of advice and warning&ndash;&ndash;then,
leaving it all unsaid, he turned wearily away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I look to find you with a sprained wrist,&#8221; he
drawled, &#8220;when I come back&ndash;&ndash;throwin&#8217; flapjacks for
them sheepmen!&#8221; He made the quick motion of turning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
a pancake in midair, smiled grimly, and galloped
after the long line of horses and packs that was
stringing along up the Bronco Mesa trail. And,
having a premonition of coming company, Hardy
went in by the fireplace and put on a big kettle of beef.
He was picking over another mess of beans when he
heard the clatter of hoofs outside and the next moment
the door was kicked violently open.</p>
<p>It was Jasper Swope who stood on the threshold,
his high Texas hat thrust far back upon his head&ndash;&ndash;and
if he felt any surprise at finding the house occupied
he gave no expression to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, there!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I thought you
folks was all gone!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; replied Hardy, and continued his work in
silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cookin&#8217; for the outfit?&#8221; queried Swope, edging in
at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; replied Hardy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, who the hell air ye cookin&#8217; fer then?&#8221; demanded
Swope, drawing nearer. &#8220;&#8217;Scuse me if I
pry into this matter, but I&#8217;m gittin&#8217; interested.&#8221;
He paused and showed a jagged set of teeth beneath
his bristling red mustache, sneeringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; answered Hardy easily.
&#8220;I thought some white man might come along later
and I&#8217;d ask him to dinner.&#8221; He fixed his eyes upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
the sheepman with an instant&#8217;s disapproval and then
resumed his cookery. As for Swope, his gray eyes
flashed sudden fire from beneath bushy eyebrows, and
then a canny smile crept across his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to be a white man, myself,&#8221; he said, &#8220;before
I lost my soap. What&#8217;s the chance to git a
bite of that bymeby?&#8221; He threw his hand out toward
the pot of beef, which was sending out odors
of a rich broth, flavored with onions and chili.</p>
<p>Hardy looked at him again, little shrimp of a man
that he was, and still with disapproval.</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye call that a white man&#8217;s way of entering another
man&#8217;s house?&#8221; he inquired pointedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; temporized Swope, and then he stopped.
&#8220;A man in my line of business gits in a hurry once
in a while,&#8221; he said lamely. &#8220;But I&#8217;m hungry, all
right,&#8221; he remarked, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Hardy, &#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed it. But here&ndash;&ndash;sit
down and eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheepman accepted the dish of beef, dipped
out a spoonful of beans, broke off a slab of bread, and
began his meal forthwith, meanwhile looking at
Hardy curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you say you&#8217;ve noticed?&#8221; he inquired,
and a quizzical smile lurked beneath his dripping
mustache as he reached over and hefted the
coffeepot.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed,&#8221; replied Hardy, &#8220;that you sheepmen
get in a hurry once in a while. You can&#8217;t stop
to knock on a door so you kick it open; can&#8217;t stop
to go around a ranch, so you go through it, and so
on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; observed Swope slyly, &#8220;so that&#8217;s what&#8217;s
bitin&#8217; you, eh? I reckon you must be that new superintendent
that Jim was tellin&#8217; about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; admitted Hardy, &#8220;and you&#8217;re Mr.
Swope, of course. Well, I&#8217;ll say this for you, Mr.
Swope, you certainly know how to get sheep across
a river. But when it comes to getting along with
cowmen,&#8221; he added, as the sheepman grinned his
self-approval, &#8220;you don&#8217;t seem to stack up very high.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t, hey?&#8221; demanded Swope defiantly.
&#8220;Well, how about the cowmen? Your friend Creede
gets along with sheepmen like a house afire, don&#8217;t
he? Him and a bunch of his punchers jumped
on one of my herders last Fall and dam&#8217; nigh beat
him to death. Did you ever hear of a sheepman
jumpin&#8217; on a cowboy? No, by Gad, and you never
will! We carry arms to protect ourselves, but we
never make no trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and combed the coffee grounds out of
his heavy red mustache with fingers that were
hooked like an eagle&#8217;s talons from clutching at sheep
in the cold water.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt, Mr. Superintendent,&#8221; he said, with
sinister directness, &#8220;that these cowmen have filled
you up about what bad <i>hombres</i> we are&ndash;&ndash;and of
course it ain&#8217;t no use to say nothin&#8217; now&ndash;&ndash;but I jest
want to tell you one thing, and I want you to remember
it if any trouble should come up; we sheepmen
have never gone beyond our legal rights, and
we&#8217;ve got the law behind us. The laws of the United
States and the statutes of this Territory guarantee
us the right to graze our sheep on public lands and
to go where we dam&#8217; please&ndash;&ndash;and we&#8217;ll go, too, you
can bank on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added this last with an assurance which left
no doubt as to his intentions, and Hardy made no
reply. His whole mind seemed centred on a handful
of beans from which he was picking out the rocks
and little lumps of clay which help to make up full
weight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; challenged Swope, after waiting for his
answer, &#8220;ain&#8217;t that straight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Hardy absently.</p>
<p>Swope glared at him for a moment disapprovingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh, you&#8217;re a hell of a cowman,&#8221; he grunted.
&#8220;What ye goin&#8217; to do about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221; inquired Hardy innocently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, you know,&#8221; replied Swope impatiently.
&#8220;How about that upper range?&#8221; He shoved back his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
chair as he spoke, and his eyes lit up in anticipation
of the battle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; responded Hardy judicially, &#8220;if you&#8217;ve
got the legal right to go up there, and if you&#8217;re goin&#8217;
where you dam&#8217; please, anyhow, it don&#8217;t look like
I could do anything.&#8221; He paused and smiled patiently
at the sheepman.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know very well, Mr. Swope,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that
if you want to go up on that mesa and sheep off the
feed we haven&#8217;t got any legal means of preventing
you. But you know, too, that there isn&#8217;t more than
enough feed for what cows the boys have left. If
you want to go up there, that&#8217;s your privilege&ndash;&ndash;and
if you want to go out over The Rolls, that&#8217;s all
right, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t give a dam&#8217;!&#8221; said Swope
satirically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you know how I feel, all right,&#8221; returned
Hardy, and then he lapsed into silence, while Swope
picked his teeth and thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you come from?&#8221; he said at last, as if,
forgetting all that had passed, his mind had come back
from a far country, unbiassed by the facts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the mountains,&#8221; replied Hardy, jerking his
thumb toward the east.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t have no sheep over there, do they?&#8221; inquired
Swope.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Nope, nothing but cattle and horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ump!&#8221; grunted the sheepman, and then, as if
the matter was settled thereby, he said: &#8220;All right,
pardner, bein&#8217; as you put it that way, I reckon I&#8217;ll
go around.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>HELL&#8217;S HIP POCKET</h3>
</div>
<p>In the days of Ahaz, king of Judah, Isaiah the
son of Amoz is reported to have seen in a vision
a wolf which dwelt with a lamb, while a lion ate
straw like an ox, and a weaned child put his hand in
the cockatrice&#8217;s den. Equally beautiful, as a dream,
was the peace at Hidden Water, where sheepman
and cattleman sat down together in amity; only,
when it was all over, the wolf wiped his chops and
turned away with a wise smile&ndash;&ndash;the millennium not
having come, as yet, in Arizona.</p>
<p>Hardy&#8217;s wrist was a little lame, figuratively speaking,
from throwing flapjacks for hungry sheep herders,
and the pile of grain and baled hay in the storehouse
had dwindled materially; but as the sheep came
through, band after band, and each turned off to the
west, stringing in long bleating columns out across
The Rolls, he did not begrudge the hard labor.
After Jasper Swope came Jim, and Donald McDonald,
as jolly a Scottish shepherd as ever lived,
and Bazan, the Mexican, who traced his blood back
to that victorious general whom Maximilian sent into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
Sonora. There were Frenchmen, smelling rank of
garlic and mutton tallow; Basques with eyes as blue
and vacant as the summer skies; young Mormons
working on shares, whose whole fortune was wrapped
up in the one huddle of sheep which they corralled and
counted so carefully; and then the common herders,
fighting Chihuahuanos, with big round heads and
staring eyes, low-browed Sonorans, slow and brutal
in their ways, men of all bloods and no blood, lumped
together in that careless, all-embracing Western term
&#8220;Mexicans.&#8221;</p>
<p>But though they were low and primitive in mental
processes, nearer to their plodding burros than to the
bright-eyed sensitive dogs, they were the best who
would consent to wander with the sheep through the
wilderness, seeing nothing, doing nothing, knowing
nothing, having before them nothing but the vision
of a distant pay day, a drunk, the <i>calabozo</i>, and the
kind boss who would surely bail them out. Ah, that
was it&ndash;&ndash;the one love and loyalty of those simple-minded
creatures who, unfit for the hurry and competition
of the great world, sold their lives by spans of
months for twenty dollars and found; it was always
to the boss that they looked for help, and in return
they did his will.</p>
<p>When the great procession had drifted past, with
its braying clamor, its dogs, its men on muleback and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
afoot, the herders with their carbines, the camp
rustlers with their burros, belled and laden with water
casks and kyacks of grub, the sheep owners hustling
about with an energy that was almost a mania, Hardy
sat beneath the <i>ramada</i> of the ranch house with dog-fighting
Tommy in his lap and pondered deeply upon
the spectacle. A hundred thousand sheep, drifting
like the shadows of clouds across the illimitable desert,
crossing swift rivers, climbing high mountains,
grazing beneath the northern pines; and then turning
south again and pouring down through the passes
like the resistless front of a cloudburst which leaves
the earth bare and wasted in its wake. For this one
time he had turned the stream aside and the tall grass
still waved upon the upper range; but the next time,
or the next&ndash;&ndash;what then?</p>
<p>Long and seriously he contemplated the matter,
dwelling now upon the rough good nature of the
sheepmen and this almost miraculous demonstration
of their good will; then remembered with vague misgivings
their protestations against the unlawful
violence which presumed to deny them what was their
legal right&ndash;&ndash;free grazing on all government lands.
And in the end he wrote a brief note to Judge Ware,
telling him that while the sheepmen had accepted his
hospitality in a most friendly spirit and had respected
the upper range, it was in his opinion only a question
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
of time until they would take the whole country,
unless they were restrained by law. He therefore
recommended that the judge look up the status of the
bill to set aside the watershed of the Salagua as a
National Forest Reserve, and in case the opposition
to it indicated any long delay it would be well either
to sell out or reduce his stock. This note he sent
out by Rafael, the Mexican roustabout, who was still
hauling in supplies from Bender, and then with a
glad heart he saddled up his horse, left a bait of meat
on the floor for Tommy, and struck out over the mesa
for Carrizo Creek.</p>
<p>After his long confinement in the pasture the sorrel
galloped along the rocky trail with the grace and
swiftness of an antelope, the warm dry wind puffed
little whirls of dust before them, and once more Hardy
felt like a man. If for the best interests of his employer
it was desirable that he cook beef and bread for
sheepmen, he could do so with good grace, but his
spirit was not that of a man who serves. Since he had
left home he had taken a great deal from the world,
patiently accepting her arrogance while he learned
her ways, but his soul had never been humbled and he
rode forth now like a king.</p>
<p>Upon that great mesa where the bronco mustangs
from the Peaks still defied the impetuosity of men,
the giant <i>sahuaros</i> towered in a mighty forest as far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
as the eye could see, yet between each stalk there
lay a wide space, studded here and there with niggerheads
of bristling spines, and fuzzy <i>chollas</i>, white as
the backs of sheep and thorny beyond reason. Nor
was this all: in the immensity of distance there was
room for <i>sahuaros</i> and niggerheads and <i>chollas</i>, and
much besides. In every gulch and sandy draw the
<i>palo verdes</i>, their yellow flowers gleaming in the sun,
stood out like lines of fire; the bottoms of the steep
ravines which gashed the mesa were illuminated with
the gaudy tassels of mesquite blossoms; gray coffee-berry
bushes clumped up against the sides of ridges,
and in every sheltered place the long grass waved its
last-year&#8217;s banners, while the fresh green of tender
growth matted the open ground like a lawn. Baby
rabbits, feeding along their runways in the grass,
sat up at his approach or hopped innocently into the
shadow of the sheltering cat-claws; jack-rabbits with
black-tipped ears galloped madly along before him,
imagining themselves pursued, and in every warm
sandy place where the lizards took the sun there was a
scattering like the flight of arrows as the long-legged
swift-jacks rose up on their toes and flew. All
nature was in a gala mood and Rufus Hardy no less.
Yet as he rode along, gazing at the dreamy beauty
of this new world, the old far-away look crept back
into his eyes, a sad, brooding look such as one often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
sees in the faces of little children who have been
crossed, and the stern lines at the corners of his mouth
were deeper when he drew rein above Carrizo Creek.</p>
<p>Below him lay the panorama of a mountain valley&ndash;&ndash;the
steep and rocky walls; the silvery stream writhing
down the middle; the green and yellow of flowers
along the lowlands; and in the middle, to give it life,
a great herd of cattle on the <i>parada</i> ground, weaving
and milling before the rushes of yelling horsemen,
intent on cutting out every steer in the herd. Beyond
lay the corrals of peeled cottonwood, and a square
house standing out stark and naked in the supreme
ugliness of corrugated iron, yet still oddly homelike
in a land where shelter was scarce. As he gazed, a
mighty voice rose up to him from the midst of the
turmoil, the blatting of calves, the mooing of cows and
the hoarse thunder of mountain bulls:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hel-lo, Rufe!&#8221;</p>
<p>From his place on the edge of the herd Hardy saw
Jefferson Creede, almost herculean on his tall horse,
waving a large black hat. Instantly he put spurs to
his sorrel and leaped down the narrow trail, and at
the edge of the herd they shook hands warmly, for
friends are scarce, wherever you go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest in time!&#8221; said Creede, grinning his welcome,
&#8220;we&#8217;re goin&#8217; over into Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket to-morrow&ndash;&ndash;the
original hole in the ground&ndash;&ndash;to bring out Bill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
Johnson&#8217;s beef critters, and I sure wanted you to
make the trip. How&#8217;d you git along with Jasp?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; responded Hardy, &#8220;he didn&#8217;t make me
any trouble. But I&#8217;m glad to get away from that
sheep smell, all the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>The big cowboy fixed his eyes upon him eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they go around?&#8221; he asked incredulously.
&#8220;Jasp and all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Hardy. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long minute Creede was silent, wrinkling his
brows as he pondered upon the miracle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what <i>I</i> want to know,&#8221; he answered
ambiguously. &#8220;But say, you&#8217;ve got a fresh horse;
jest take my place here while me and Uncle Bill over
there show them ignorant punchers how to cut cattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>He circled rapidly about the herd and, riding out
into the runway where the cattle were sifted, the beef
steers being jumped across the open into the hold-up
herd and the cows and calves turned back, he held up
his hand for the work to stop. Then by signals he
sent the galloping horsemen back to the edge of the
herd and beckoned for old Bill Johnson.</p>
<p>For a few minutes he sat quietly on his horse,
waiting for the harassed cattle to stop their milling.
Then breaking into a song such as cowboys sing at
night he rode slowly in among them, threading about
at random, while old Bill Johnson on his ancient mare
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
did likewise, his tangled beard swaying idly in the
breeze. On the border of the herd they edged in as
if by accident upon a fat steer and walked him
amiably forth into the open. Another followed out
of natural perversity, and when both were nicely
started toward the beef cut the two men drifted back
once more into the herd. There was no running, no
shouting, no gallant show of horsemanship, but somehow
the right steers wandered over into the beef cut
and stayed there. As if by magic spell the outlaws
and &#8220;snakes&#8221; became good, and with no breaks for
the hills the labor of an afternoon was accomplished in
the space of two dull and uneventful hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to cut cattle!&#8221; announced Creede,
as they turned the discard toward the hills. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t
it, Bill?&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to Johnson who, sitting astride a flea-bitten
gray mare that seemed to be in a perpetual
doze, looked more like an Apache squaw than a boss
cowboy. The old man&#8217;s clothes were even more
ragged than when Hardy had seen him at Bender, his
copper-riveted hat was further reinforced by a buckskin
thong around the rim, and his knees were short-stirruped
almost up to his elbows by the puny little
boy&#8217;s saddle that he rode, but his fiery eyes were as
quick and piercing as ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shore thing,&#8221; he said, straightening up jauntily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
in his saddle, &#8220;that&#8217;s my way! Be&#8217;n doin&#8217; it fer
years, while you boys was killin&#8217; horses, but it takes
Jeff hyar to see the p&#8217;int. Be gentle, boys, be gentle
with um&ndash;&ndash;you don&#8217;t gain nawthin&#8217; fer all yer hard
ridin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>He cut off a chew of tobacco and tucked it carefully
away in his cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeff hyar,&#8221; he continued, as the bunch of cowboys
began to josh and laugh among themselves, &#8220;he comes
by his savvy right&ndash;&ndash;his paw was a smart man before
him, and mighty clever to his friends, to boot.
Many&#8217;s the time I hev took little Jeffie down the river
and learned him tracks and beaver signs when he
wasn&#8217;t knee-high to a grasshopper&ndash;&ndash;hain&#8217;t I, Jeff?
And when I tell him to be gentle with them cows he
knows I&#8217;m right. I jest want you boys to take
notice when you go down into the Pocket to-morrer
what kin be done by kindness; and the first man that
hollers or puts a rope on my gentle stock, I&#8217;ll sure
make him hard to ketch.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hear me, naow,&#8221; he cried, turning sharply
upon Bill Lightfoot, who was getting off something
about &#8220;Little Jeffie,&#8221; and then for the first time he
saw the face of the new cowboy who had ridden in
that afternoon. Not since the day he was drunk at
Bender had Bill Johnson set eyes upon the little man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
to whom he had sworn off, but he recognized him
instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello thar, pardner!&#8221; he exclaimed, reining his
mare in abruptly. &#8220;Whar&#8217;d you drop down from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why howdy do, Mr. Johnson!&#8221; answered Hardy,
shaking hands, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you again. Jeff told
me he was going down to your ranch to-morrow and
I looked to see you then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill Johnson allowed this polite speech to pass over
his shoulder without response. Then, drawing Hardy
aside, he began to talk confidentially; expounding to
the full his system of gentling cattle; launching forth
his invective, which was of the pioneer variety, upon
the head of all sheepmen; and finally coming around
with a jerk to the subject that was uppermost in his
mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want to ask you a question&ndash;&ndash;are
you any relation to the Captain Hardy that I
served with over at Fort Apache? Seems&#8217;s if you
look like &#8217;im, only smaller.&#8221;</p>
<p>His stature was a sore point with Hardy, and
especially in connection with his father, but making
allowance for Mr. Johnson&#8217;s ways he modestly admitted
his ancestry.</p>
<p>&#8220;His son, eh!&#8221; echoed the old man. &#8220;Waal&ndash;&ndash;now!
I tell you, boy, I <i>knowed</i> you&ndash;&ndash;I knowed you the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
minute you called down that dog-robber of a barkeep&ndash;&ndash;and
I was half drunk, too. And so you&#8217;re the
new superintendent down at the Dos S, eh? Waal,
all I can say is: God help them pore sheepmen if you
ever git on their trail. I used to chase Apaches with
yore paw, boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Bill Johnson&#8217;s turn to talk that evening
and like most solitaries who have not &#8220;gone into the
silence,&#8221; he availed himself of a listener with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Stories of lion hunts and &#8220;b&#8217;ar fights&#8221; fell as trippingly
from his lips as the words of a professional
monologist, and when he had finished his account of
the exploits of Captain Samuel Barrows Hardy, even
the envious Lightfoot regarded Rufus with a new
respect, for there is no higher honor in Arizona than
to be the son of an Indian fighter. And when the
last man had crawled wearily into his blankets the old
hermit still sat by the dying fire poking the charred
ends into the flames and holding forth to the young
superintendent upon the courage of his sire.</p>
<p>Hardly had the son of his father crept under the
edge of Creede&#8217;s blankets and dropped to sleep before
that huge mountain of energy rose up and gave the
long yell. The morning was at its blackest, that
murky four <span class='smcap'>A. M.</span> darkness which precedes the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
glimmer of light; but the day&#8217;s work had to be done.
The shivering horse-wrangler stamped on his boots
and struck out down the ca&ntilde;on after the <i>remuda</i>, two
or three cooks got busy about the fire which roared
higher and higher as they piled on the ironwood to
make coals, and before the sun had more than
mounted the southern shoulder of the Four Peaks
the long line of horsemen was well on the trail to
Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket.</p>
<p>The frontier imagination had in no wise overleaped
itself in naming this abyss. Even the tribute which
Facilis Descensus Vergil paid to the local Roman hell
could hardly be said of the Pocket&ndash;&ndash;it is not even
easy to get into it. From the top of the divide it
looks like a valley submerged in a smoky haze through
which the peaks and pinnacles of the lower parks rise
up like cathedral spires, pointing solemnly to heaven.
As the trail descends through washed-out gulches and
&#8220;stone-patches,&#8221; now skating along the backbone of
a ridge and now dropping as abruptly into some
hollow waterway, the cliffs and pinnacles begin to
loom up against the sky; then they seem to close in and
block the way, and just as the ca&ntilde;on boxes in to
nothing the trail slips into a gash in the face of the
cliff where the soft sandstone has crumbled away between
two harder strata, and climbs precariously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
along through the sombre gloom of the gorge to the
bright light of the fair valley beyond.</p>
<p>It is a kind of fairy land, that hidden pocket in the
hills, always covered by a mystic haze, for which the
Mexicans give it the name <i>Humada</i>. Its steep ca&ntilde;on
comes down from the breast of the most easterly of
the Four Peaks, impassable except by the one trail; it
passes through the box and there widens out into a
beautiful valley, where the grass lies along the hillsides
like the tawny mane of a lion, and tender flowers
stand untrampled in the rich bottoms. For three
miles or more it spreads out between striated cliffs
where hawks and eagles make their nests; then once
more it closes in, the creek plunges down a narrow
gorge and disappears, writhing tortuously on its way
to the Salagua whose fire-blasted walls rise in huge
bulwarks against the south, dwarfing the near-by
cliffs into nothingness by their majestic height.</p>
<p>In the presence of this unearthly beauty and
grandeur old Bill Johnson&ndash;&ndash;ex-trapper, ex-soldier,
ex-prospector, ex-everything&ndash;&ndash;had dwelt for twenty
years, dating from the days when his house was his
fortress, and his one desire was to stand off the
Apaches until he could find the Lost Dutchman.</p>
<p>Where the valley narrowed down for its final
plunge into the gorge the old trapper had built his
cabin, its walls laid &#8220;square with the world&#8221; by sighting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
on the North Star. When the sun entered the
threshold of the western door it was noon, and
his watch never ran down. The cabin was built of
shaly rocks, squared and laid in mud, like bricks; a
tremendous stone chimney stood against the north
end and a corral for his burros at the south. Three
hounds with bleared eyes and flapping ears, their foreheads
wrinkled with age and the anxieties of the hunt,
bayed forth a welcome as the cavalcade strung in
across the valley; and mild-eyed cattle, standing on
the ridges to catch the wind, stared down at them in
surprise. Never, even at San Carlos, where the
Chiricahua cattle fatten on the best feed in Arizona,
had Hardy seen such mountains of beef. Old steers
with six and seven rings on their horns hung about
the salting places, as if there were no such things as
beef drives and slaughter houses in this cruel world,
and even when the cowboys spread out like a fan and
brought them all in to the cutting grounds there was
hardly a calf that bawled.</p>
<p>As the three or four hundred head that made up
his entire earthly possession drifted obediently in, the
old man rode up to Creede and Hardy and waved
his hand expansively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar, boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;thar&#8217;s the results of peace
and kindness. Nary a critter thar that I heven&#8217;t
scratched between the horns since the day his maw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
brought him down to the salt lick. I even git Jeff
and the boys to brand and earmark &#8217;em fer me, so
they won&#8217;t hev no hard feelin&#8217; fer the Old Man.
D&#8217;ye see that big white-faced steer?&#8221; he asked, pointing
with pride to the monarch of the herd. &#8220;Waal,
how much ye think he&#8217;ll weigh?&#8221; he demanded, turning
to Creede. &#8220;Fifteen hundred?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um, more &#8217;n that,&#8221; responded Creede, squinting
his eyes down judicially. &#8220;Them Herefords are
awful solid when they git big. I reckon he&#8217;ll run
nigh onto seventeen hundred, Bill.&#8221; He paused and
winked furtively at Hardy. &#8220;I kin git fifty dollars
fer that old boy, jest the way he stands,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and bein&#8217; as he can&#8217;t carry no more weight nohow,
I&#8217;ll jest cut him into the town herd right now,
and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hyar!&#8221; shouted Johnson, grabbing the cowboy&#8217;s
bridle, &#8220;who&#8217;s doin&#8217; this, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y <i>you</i>, Bill,&#8221; answered Creede innocently,
&#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, then,&#8221; said the old man shortly,
&#8220;you leave that steer alone. I&#8217;ll jest cut this herd to
suit myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over at the branding pen the irons were on the
fire and the marking was progressing rapidly, but out
in the open Mr. Bill Johnson was making slow work
of his cut.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He gets stuck on them cows, like an Irishman with
his pig,&#8221; observed Creede, as the old man turned back
a prime four-year-old. &#8220;He&#8217;d rather be barbecued
by the Apaches than part with that big white-faced
boy. If I owned &#8217;em I&#8217;d send down a lot of them
big fat brutes and buy doggies; but Bill spends all
the money he gits fer booze anyhow, so I reckon it&#8217;s
all right. He generally sends out about twenty runts
and roughs, and lets it go at that. Say! You&#8217;ll
have to git a move on, Bill,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;we want to
send that beef cut on ahead!&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man reined in his mare and surveyed the
big herd critically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Waal,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;I reckon that&#8217;ll do fer this
trip, then. Take &#8217;em along. And the fust one of
you punchers that hits one of them critters over the
tail with his hondu,&#8221; he shouted, as the eager horsemen
trotted over to start them, &#8220;will hev me to
lick!&#8221;</p>
<p>He placed an order for provisions with Creede,
asked him to keep the supplies at Hidden Water until
he came over for them with the burros, and turned
away contentedly as the cowboys went upon their
way.</p>
<p>Down by the branding pen the mother cows licked
the blood from their offsprings&#8217; mangled ears and
mooed resentfully, but the big white-faced steer stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
in brutish content on the salting grounds and gazed
after the town herd thoughtfully.</p>
<p>A bunch of burros gathered about the doorway of
the cabin, snooping for bacon rinds; the hounds leaned
their heavy jowls upon his knees and gazed up
worshipfully into their master&#8217;s face; and as the sun
dipped down toward the rim of the mighty cliffs that
shut him in, the lord of Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket broke into
the chorus of an ancient song:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;Oh, <i>o</i>-ver the prairies, and <i>o</i>-ver the mountains,<br />

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>A YEAR&#8217;S MAIL</h3>
</div>
<p>The beef herd was safely delivered at Bender, the
feeders disposed of at Moroni, and the checks
sent on to the absentee owner, who did not know a
steer from a stag; the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> hands were paid off and
successfully launched upon their big drunk; bills were
paid and the Summer&#8217;s supplies ordered in, and then
at last the superintendent and <i>rod&eacute;o</i> boss settled down
to a little domesticity.</p>
<p>Since the day that Hardy had declined to drink
with him Creede had quietly taken to water, and he
planted a bag of his accumulated wages in a corner
of the mud floor, to see, as he facetiously expressed it,
if it would grow. Mr. Bill Johnson had also saved
his &#8220;cow money&#8221; from Black Tex and banked it with
Hardy, who had a little cache of his own, as well.
With their finances thus nicely disposed of the two
partners swept the floor, cleaned up the cooking
dishes, farmed out their laundry to a squaw, and set
their house in order generally. They were just
greasing up their <i>reatas</i> for a run after the wild
horses of Bronco Mesa when Rafael pulled in with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
a wagon-load of supplies and destroyed their peaceful
life.</p>
<p>It was late when the grinding and hammering of
wheels upon the boulders of the creek-bed announced
his near approach and Creede went out to help unload
the provisions. A few minutes later he stepped into
the room where Hardy was busily cooking and stood
across the table from him with his hands behind his
back, grinning mischievously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rufe,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got a girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardy looked up quickly and caught the significance
of his pose, but he did not smile. He did not
even show an interest in the play.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you figure that out?&#8221; he asked, indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know,&#8221; drawled Creede. &#8220;Got a letter from
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>A single hawk-like glance was the only answer to
this sally.</p>
<p>&#8220;She says: &#8216;Why the hell don&#8217;t you write!&#8217;&#8221; volunteered
the cowboy.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;S that so!&#8221; commented Hardy, and then he went
on with his cooking.</p>
<p>For a minute Creede stood watching him, his eyes
keen to detect the slightest quaver, but the little man
seemed suddenly to have forgotten him; he moved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
about absently, mechanically, dropping nothing, burning
nothing, yet far away, as in a dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; exclaimed Creede, disgusted with his own
make-believe, &#8220;you don&#8217;t seem to care whether school
keeps or not. I&#8217;ll excuse you from any further work
this evenin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;here&#8217;s your mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew a bundle of letters from behind his back
and dropped it heavily upon the table, but even then
Hardy did not rise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess the Old Man must&#8217;ve forwarded my mail,&#8221;
he remarked, smiling at the size of the pack. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been knocking around so, I haven&#8217;t received a letter
in a year. Chuck &#8217;em on my desk, will ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; responded Creede, and stepping across the
broad living-room he threw the bundle carelessly on
the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re like me,&#8221; he remarked, drawing his chair
up sociably to supper, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t got a letter fer so
long I never go near the dam&#8217; post office.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sighed, and filled his plate with beans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever been in St. Louis?&#8221; he inquired casually.
&#8220;No? They say it&#8217;s a fine burg. Think I&#8217;ll save
up my <i>dinero</i> and try it a whirl some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The supper table was cleared and Creede had lit his
second cigarette before Hardy reverted to the matter
of his mail.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I might as well look over those
letters&ndash;&ndash;may be a thousand-dollar check amongst
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, stepping into his room, he picked up the
package, examined it curiously, and cut the cords with
his knife.</p>
<p>A sheaf of twenty or more letters spilled out and,
sitting on the edge of the bed, he shuffled them over
in the uncertain light of the fire, noting each inscription
with a quick glance; and as he gathered up the
last he quietly tucked three of them beneath the folds
of his blankets&ndash;&ndash;two in the same hand, bold and
dashing yet stamped with a certain feminine delicacy
and grace, and each envelope of a pale blue; the third
also feminine, but inscribed in black and white, a
crooked little hand that strayed across the page, yet
modestly shrank from trespassing on the stamp.</p>
<p>With the remainder of his mail Hardy blundered
over to the table, dumping the loose handful in a
great pile before the weak glimmer of the lamp.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; he said, as Creede blinked at the heap, &#8220;I
reckon that&#8217;s mail enough for both of us. You can
read the advertisements and I&#8217;ll see what the judge
has to say for himself. Pitch in, now.&#8221; He waved
his hand towards a lot of business envelopes, but
Creede shook his head and continued to smoke
dreamily.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; he said briefly, &#8220;don&#8217;t interest me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached out and thumbed the letters over
dumbly, spelling out a long word here and there or
scrutinizing some obscure handwriting curiously, as if
it were Chinese, or an Indian sign on a rock. Then,
shoving back his chair, he watched Hardy&#8217;s face as he
skimmed rapidly through the first letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good news in the first part of it and bad in the
last,&#8221; he remarked, as Hardy put it down.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; admitted Hardy, &#8220;but how&#8217;d you
know?&#8221;</p>
<p>He gazed up at his complacent partner with a look
of innocent wonder, and Creede laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y, hell boy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I can read you like a
book. Your face tells the whole story as you go
along. After you&#8217;ve been down here in Arizona a
few seasons and got them big eyes of yourn squinched
down a little&ndash;&ndash;well, I may have to ast you a few
questions, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waved his hand in a large gesture and blew out
a cloud of smoke, while a twinkle of amusement crept
into Hardy&#8217;s unsquinched eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m smoother than I look,&#8221; he suggested
dryly. &#8220;You big, fat fellows get so self-satisfied
sometimes that you let lots of things go by you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll take my chances on you,&#8221; answered
Creede placidly. &#8220;What did the old judge say?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He says you did fine with the cattle,&#8221; said Hardy,
&#8220;and sold &#8217;em just in time&ndash;&ndash;the market fell off within
a week after we shipped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um-huh,&#8221; grunted Creede. &#8220;And what&#8217;s the bad
bunch of news at the end?&#8221;</p>
<p>The bad bunch of news was really of a personal
nature, stirring up unpleasant memories, but Hardy
passed it off by a little benevolent dissimulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says he&#8217;s mighty glad I steered the sheep
away, but there is something funny going on back in
Washington; some combine of the sheep and lumber
interests has got in and blocked the whole Forest
Reserve business and there won&#8217;t be any Salagua
Forest Reserve this year. So I guess my job of
sheep-wrangler is going to hold; at least the judge
asked me to stay with it until Fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you stay then, Rufe,&#8221; said Creede earnestly,
&#8220;because I&#8217;ve kinder got stuck on you&ndash;&ndash;I like your
style,&#8221; he added half apologetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Jeff,&#8221; said Hardy. &#8220;Here&#8217;s another
letter&ndash;&ndash;from my father. See if you can guess what
it is like.&#8221;</p>
<p>He set his face rigidly and read the short letter
through without a quaver.</p>
<p>&#8220;You and the Old Man have had a fallin&#8217;-out,&#8221;
observed Creede, with a shrewd grin, &#8220;and he says
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
when you git good and tired of bein&#8217; a dam&#8217; fool you
might as well come home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s about the size of it,&#8221; admitted Hardy.
&#8220;I never told you much about my father, did I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never knew you had one,&#8221; said Creede, &#8220;until
Bill Johnson began to blow about what an Injun-fighter
he was. I reckon that&#8217;s where you git your
sportin&#8217; blood, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; began Hardy. &#8220;The Old
Man and I never did get along together. He&#8217;s used
to commanding soldiers and all that, and I&#8217;m kind of
quiet, but he always took a sneaking pride in me
when I was a boy, I guess. Anyway, every time I&#8217;d
get into a fight around the post and lick two or three
Mexican kids, or do some good work riding or shooting,
he&#8217;d say I&#8217;d be a man before my mother, or
something like that&ndash;&ndash;but that was as far as he got.
And all the time, on the quiet, he was educating me
for the Army. His father was a captain, and he&#8217;s a
colonel, and I can see now he was lotting on my doing
as well or better&ndash;&ndash;but hell, that only made matters
worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>He slid down in his chair and gazed into the fire
gloomily. It was the first time Creede had heard his
partner use even the mildest of the range expletives,
for in that particular he was still a tenderfoot, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
word suddenly conveyed to him the depths of the little
man&#8217;s abandonment and despair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;what was the matter?&#8221; he inquired sympathetically.
&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you git no appointment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; growled Hardy. &#8220;I guess you know, all
right. Look at me!&#8221; he exclaimed, in a sudden gust
of passion and resentment. &#8220;Why, damn it, man,
I&#8217;m an inch too short!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;be&ndash;&ndash;dogged!&#8221; breathed Creede. &#8220;I
never thought of that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; rejoined Hardy bitterly, &#8220;nor the Old Man,
either&ndash;&ndash;not until I stopped growing! Well, he
hasn&#8217;t had a bit of use for me since. That&#8217;s the size
of it. And he didn&#8217;t take any pains to conceal the
fact&ndash;&ndash;most army men don&#8217;t. There&#8217;s only one man
in the world to them, and that&#8217;s a soldier; and if
you&#8217;re not a soldier, you&#8217;re nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waved a hand as if dismissing himself from the
universe, and sank moodily into his seat, while Creede
looked him over in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rufe,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;d&#8217;ye remember that time
when I picked you to be boss sheep-wrangler, down
at Bender? Well, I might as well tell you about
that now&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;t won&#8217;t do no harm. The old judge
couldn&#8217;t figure out what it was I see in you to
recommend you for the job. Like&#8217;s not you don&#8217;t
know yourself. <i>He</i> thought I was pickin&#8217; you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
because you was a peaceful guy, and wouldn&#8217;t fight
Black Tex; but that&#8217;s where he got fooled, and fooled bad!
I picked you because I knew dam&#8217; well you
<i>would</i> fight!&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaned far over across the table and his eyes
glowed with a fierce light.</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye think I want some little suckin&#8217; mamma&#8217;s-joy
of a diplomat on my hands when it comes to a
show-down with them sheepmen?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;No, by
God, I want a <i>man</i>, and you&#8217;re the boy, Rufe; so
shake!&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose and held out his hand. Hardy took it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have sprung this on you, pardner,&#8221; he
continued apologetically, &#8220;if I didn&#8217;t see you so
kinder down in the mouth about your old man. But
I jest want you to know that they&#8217;s one man that
appreciates you for a plain scrapper. And I&#8217;ll tell
you another thing; when the time comes you&#8217;ll look
jest as big over the top of a six-shooter as I do, and
stand only half the chanst to git hit. W&#8217;y, shucks!&#8221;
he exclaimed magnanimously, &#8220;my size is agin&#8217; me at
every turn; my horse can&#8217;t hardly pack me, I eat such
a hell of a lot, and, well, I never can git a pair of pants
to fit me. What&#8217;s this here letter?&#8221;</p>
<p>He picked one up at random, and Hardy ascertained
that his tailor some six months previously had
moved to a new and more central location, where he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
would be pleased to welcome all his old customers.
But the subject of diminutive size was effectually dismissed
and, having cheered up his little friend as best
he could, Creede seized the occasion to retire. Lying
upon his broad back in his blankets, with Tommy
purring comfortably in the hollow of his arm, he
smoked out his cigarette in speculative silence, gazing
up at the familiar stars whose wheelings mark off the
cowboy&#8217;s night, and then dropped quietly to sleep,
leaving his partner to brood over his letters alone.</p>
<p>For a long time he sat there, opening them one by
one&ndash;&ndash;the vague and indifferent letters which drift in
while one is gone; and at last he stole silently across
the dirt floor and brought out the three letters from
his bed. There in a moment, if he had been present,
Creede might have read him like a book; his lips
drawn tight, his eyes big and staring, as he tore open
one of the pale blue envelopes with trembling hands.
The fragments of a violet, shattered by the long
journey, fell before him as he plucked out the note,
and its delicate fragrance rose up like incense as he
read. He hurried through the missive, as if seeking
something which was not there, then his hungry eyes
left the unprofitable page and wandered about the
empty room, only to come back to those last words:
&#8220;Always your Friend, Kitty Bonnair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always your friend,&#8221; he repeated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
bitterly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;always your friend. Ah, God!&#8221; He sighed wearily
and shook his head. For a moment he lapsed into
dreams; then, reaching out, he picked up the second
letter, postmarked over a year before, and examined
it idly. The very hour of its collection was recorded&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Ferry
Sta. 1.30 <span class='smcap'>A. M.</span>&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and the date he could
never forget. Written on that very same day, and
yet its message had never reached him!</p>
<p>He could see as in a vision the shrouded form of
Kitty Bonnair slipping from her door at midnight to
fling a final word after him, not knowing how far he
would flee; he could see the lonely mail collector, half
obscured in the San Francisco fog, as he scooped the
letter from the box with many others and boarded the
car for the ferry. It was a last retort, and likely
bitter, for he had spoken in anger himself, and Kitty
was not a woman to be denied. There was an exaggerated
quirk to the square corners of her letters, a
brusque shading of the down strokes&ndash;&ndash;undoubtedly
Kitty was angry. But for once he had disarmed her&ndash;&ndash;it
was a year after, now, and he had read her forgiveness
first! Yet it was with a strange sinking of the
heart that he opened the blue envelope and stared at
the scribbled words:</p>
<p><span class='smcap'>Dear Friend That Was</span>: My heart is very sore to-night&ndash;&ndash;I
had trusted you so&ndash;&ndash;I had depended upon you so&ndash;&ndash;and
now you have deliberately broken all your faith and promises.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
Rufus, I had thought you different from other men&ndash;&ndash;more
gentle, more considerate, more capable of a true friendship
which I fondly hoped would last forever&ndash;&ndash;but now, oh, I can
never forgive you! Just when life was heaviest with disappointments,
just when I was leaning upon you most as a true
friend and comrade&ndash;&ndash;then you must needs spoil it all. And
after I had told you I could never love any one! Have you
forgotten all that I told you in the balcony? Have you forgotten
all that I have risked for the friendship I held so dear?
And then to spoil it all! Oh, I hate you&ndash;&ndash;I hate you!</p>
<p>He stopped and stiffened in his chair, and his eyes
turned wild with horror; then he gathered his letters
together blindly and crept away to bed. In the morning
he arose and went about his work with mouse-like
quietness, performing all things thoroughly and well,
talking, even laughing, yet with a droop like that of a
wounded creature that seeks only to hide and escape.</p>
<p>Creede watched him furtively, hung around the
house for a while, then strode out to the pasture and
caught up his horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be back this aft,&#8221; he said, and rode majestically
away up the ca&ntilde;on, where he would be out of the way.
For men, too, have their instincts and intuitions, and
they are even willing to leave alone that which they
cannot remedy and do not understand.</p>
<p>As Creede galloped off, leaving the ranch of a
sudden lonely and quiet, Tommy poked his head
anxiously out through a slit in the canvas bottom of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
the screen door and began to cry&ndash;&ndash;his poor cracked
voice, all broken from calling for help from the
coyotes, quavering dismally. In his most raucous
tones he continued this lament for his master until at
last Hardy gathered him up and held him to his
breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Kitty, Kitty,&#8221; he said, and at the caressing
note in his voice the black cat began to purr hoarsely,
raising his scrawny head in the ecstasy of being loved.
Thief and reprobate though he was, and sadly given
to leaping upon the table and flying spitefully at dogs,
even that rough creature felt the need of love; how
much more the sensitive and high-bred man, once poet
and scholar, now cowboy and sheep-wrangler, but
always the unhappy slave of Kitty Bonnair.</p>
<p>The two letters lay charred to ashes among the
glowing coals, but their words, even the kindest
meant, were seared deep in his heart, fresh hurts upon
older scars, and as he sat staring at the gaunt <i>sahuaros</i>
on the hilltops he meditated gloomily upon his reply.
Then, depositing Tommy on the bed, he sat down at
his desk before the iron-barred window and began to
write.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEAR FRIEND THAT WAS: Your two letters came together&ndash;&ndash;the
one that you have just sent, and the one written on
that same night, which I hope I may some day forget. It
was not a very kind letter&ndash;&ndash;I am sorry that I should ever have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
offended you, but it was not gently done. No friend could
ever speak so to another, I am sure. As for the cause, I am
a human being, a man like other men, and I am not ashamed.
Yet that I should so fail to read your mind I am ashamed.
Perhaps it was my egotism, which made me over-bold, thinking
that any woman could love me. But if what I offered was
nothing to you, if even for a moment you hated me, it is
enough. Now for all this talk of friendship&ndash;&ndash;I am not your
friend and never will be; and if, after what has passed, you
are my friend, I ask but one thing&ndash;&ndash;let me forget. For I
will never come back, I will never write, I will never submit.
Surely, with all that life offers you, you can spare me the
humiliation of being angry with you.</p>
<p>I am now engaged in work which, out of consideration for
Judge Ware, I cannot leave; otherwise I would not ask you
not to write to me.</p>
<p>Trusting that you will remember me kindly to your mother,
I remain, sincerely,</p>
<p class='ralign'><span class='smcap'>Rufus Hardy.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He signed his name at the bottom, folded the sheet
carefully, and thrust the sealed envelope into an inner
pocket. Then for the first time, he drew out the
third letter and spread its pages before him&ndash;&ndash;a long
letter, full of news, yet asking no questions. The
tense lines about his lips relaxed as he read, he smiled
whimsically as he heard of the queer doings of his old-time
friends; how these two had run away and got
married in order to escape a church wedding, how
Tupper Browne had painted a likeness of Mather
in Hades&ndash;&ndash;after the &#8220;Dante&#8221; of Dor&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;and had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
detected in the act; and then this little note, cued in
casually near the end:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kitty Bonnair has given up art for the present on account
of her eyes, and has gone in for physical culture and riding
lessons in the park. She dropped in at the last meeting of
The Circle, and I told her how curiously father had encountered
you at Bender. We all miss you very much at The
Circle&ndash;&ndash;in fact, it is not doing so well of late. Kitty has not
attended a meeting in months, and I often wonder where we
may look for another Poet, Philosopher, and Friend&ndash;&ndash;unless
you will come back! Father did not tell me where you had
been or what you intended to do, but I hope you have not
given up the Muse. To encourage you I will send down a
book, now and then, and you may send me a poem. Is it a
bargain? Then good-bye.</p>
<p class='ralign'>With best wishes,<span class='rindent18'>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span class='smcap'>Lucy Ware.</span><span class='rindent7'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>P. S.&ndash;&ndash;I met your father on the street the other day, and
he seemed very much pleased to hear how well you were getting
along.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hardy put the letter down and sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now there&#8217;s a thoroughly nice girl,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
wonder why she doesn&#8217;t get married.&#8221; Then, reaching
for a fresh sheet of paper, he began to write,
describing the beauty of the country; the noble qualities
of his horse, Chapuli, the Grasshopper; the march
of the vast army of sheep; Creede, Tommy, and whatnot,
with all the pent-up enthusiasm of a year&#8217;s loneliness.
When it was ended he looked at the letter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
with a smile, wondering whether to send it by freight
or express. Six cents in stamps was the final solution
of the problem, and as his pocketbook contained only
four he stuck them on and awaited his partner&#8217;s
return.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Jeff,&#8221; he called, as Creede came in from the
pasture, &#8220;have you got any stamps?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any which?&#8221; inquired Creede suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any postage stamps&ndash;&ndash;to put on letters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; exclaimed Creede. &#8220;You must think I&#8217;ve
got a girl&ndash;&ndash;or important business in the States. No,
I&#8217;ll tell you. The only stamp I&#8217;ve got is in a glass
frame, hung up on the wall&ndash;&ndash;picture of George Washington,
you know. Haven&#8217;t you never seen it?
W&#8217;y, it&#8217;s right there in the parler&ndash;&ndash;jest above the
pianney&ndash;&ndash;and a jim-dandy piece of steel engraving
she is, too.&#8221; He grinned broadly as he concluded this
running fire of jest, but his partner remained serious
to the end.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll go down to Moroni in
the morning, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What ye goin&#8217; down there for?&#8221; demanded Creede
incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, to buy a stamp, of course,&#8221; replied Hardy,
&#8220;it&#8217;s only forty miles, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; And early in the
morning, true to his word, he saddled up Chapuli and
struck out down the river.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>From the doorway Creede watched him curiously,
his lips parted in a dubious smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something funny goin&#8217; on here, ladies,&#8221; he
observed sagely, &#8220;something funny&ndash;&ndash;and I&#8217;m dogged
if I savvy what it is.&#8221; He stooped and scooped
up Tommy in one giant paw. &#8220;Well, Tom, Old
Socks,&#8221; he said, holding him up where he could
sniff delicately at the rafters, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got a pretty
good nose, how about it, now&ndash;&ndash;can you smell a rat?&#8221;
But even Tommy could not explain why a man should
ride forty miles in order to buy a stamp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>MORONI</h3>
</div>
<p>The Mormon settlement of Moroni proved to belong
to that large class of Western &#8220;cities&#8221;
known as &#8220;string-towns&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;a long line of stores on
either side of a main street, brick where fires have
swept away the shacks, and wood with false fronts
where dynamite or a change of wind has checked the
conflagration; a miscellaneous conglomeration of
saloons, restaurants, general stores, and livery stables,
all very satisfying to the material wants of man, but
in the ensemble not over-pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>At first glance, Moroni might have been Reno,
Nevada; or Gilroy, California; or Deming, New
Mexico; or even Bender&ndash;&ndash;except for the railroad. A
second glance, however, disclosed a smaller number of
disconsolate cow ponies standing in front of the
saloons and a larger number of family rigs tied to the
horse rack in front of Swope&#8217;s Store; there was also a
tithing house with many doors, a brick church, and
women and children galore. And for twenty miles
around there was nothing but flowing canals and irrigated
fields waving with wheat and alfalfa, all so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
green and prosperous that a stranger from the back
country was likely to develop a strong leaning toward
the faith before he reached town and noticed the
tithing house.</p>
<p>As for Hardy, his eyes, so long accustomed to the
green lawns and trees of Berkeley, turned almost
wistful as he gazed away across the rich fields, dotted
with cocks of hay or resounding to the whirr of the
mower; but for the sweating Latter Day Saints who
labored in the fields, he had nothing but the pitying
contempt of the cowboy. It was a fine large country,
to be sure, and produced a lot of very necessary horse
feed, but Chapuli shied when his feet struck the
freshly sprinkled street, and somehow his master felt
equally ill at ease.</p>
<p>Having purchased his stamp and eaten supper, he
was wandering aimlessly up and down the street&ndash;&ndash;that
being the only pleasure and recourse of an Arizona
town outside the doors of a saloon&ndash;&ndash;when in the
medley of heterogeneous sounds he heard a familiar
voice boom out and as abruptly stop. It was evening
and the stores were closed, but various citizens still sat
along the edge of the sidewalk, smoking and talking
in the semi-darkness. Hardy paused and listened
a moment. The voice which he had heard was that of
no ordinary man; it was deep and resonant, with a
rough, overbearing note almost military in its brusqueness;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
but it had ceased and another voice, low and
protesting, had taken its place. In the gloom he
could just make out the forms of the two men, sitting
on their heels against the wall and engaged in a
one-sided argument. The man with the Southern
drawl was doing all the talking, but as Hardy passed
by, the other cut in on him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he demanded in masterful tones, &#8220;what ye
goin&#8217; to do about it?&#8221; Then, without waiting for an
answer, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, there, Mr. Hardy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; responded Hardy. &#8220;Who is this, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Swope,&#8221; replied the voice, with dignified
directness. &#8220;What&#8217;re you doing in these parts?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Came down to buy a postage stamp,&#8221; replied
Hardy, following a habit he had of telling the truth in
details.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; grunted Swope. &#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder you
wouldn&#8217;t go to Bender for it&ndash;&ndash;that Jew over there
might make you a rate!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; responded Hardy, ignoring the too-evident
desire of the Moroni storekeeper to draw him
into an argument. &#8220;He couldn&#8217;t do it&ndash;&ndash;they say the
Government loses money every time it sells one. Nice
town you&#8217;ve got down here,&#8221; he remarked, by way of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
a parting compliment; but Swope was not satisfied to
let him escape so easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, there!&#8221; he exclaimed, rousing up from
his place. &#8220;What&#8217;s your bloody hurry? Come on
back here and shake hands with Mr. Thomas&ndash;&ndash;Mr.
Thomas is my boss herder up in Apache County.
Thinking of bringing him down here next Fall,&#8221; he
added laconically, and by the subtle change in his
voice Hardy realized intuitively that that move had
been the subject of their interrupted argument.
More than that, he felt vaguely that he himself was
somehow involved in the discussion, the more so as
Mr. Thomas balked absolutely at shaking hands with
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope Mr. Thomas will find it convenient to stop
at the ranch,&#8221; he murmured pleasantly, &#8220;but don&#8217;t let
me interfere with your business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess that&#8217;s all to-night, Shep,&#8221; remarked
Swope, taking charge of the situation. &#8220;I jest wanted
you to meet Hardy while you was together. This is
the Mr. Hardy, of the Dos S outfit, you understand,&#8221;
he continued, &#8220;and a white cowman! If you have to
go across his range, go quick&ndash;&ndash;and tell your men the
same. I want them dam&#8217; tail-twisters up in that
Four Peaks country to know that it pays to be decent
to a sheepman, and I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to show some of &#8217;em,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
too, before I git through! But any time my sheep
happen to git on your range, Mr. Hardy,&#8221; he added
reassuringly, &#8220;you jest order &#8217;em off, and Mr. Thomas
here will see to it that they go!&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned upon his boss herder with a menacing
gesture, as if charging him with silence, and Thomas,
whose sole contribution to the conversation had been
a grunt at the end, swung about and ambled sullenly
off up the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feelin&#8217; kinder bad to-night,&#8221; explained Swope, as
his <i>mayordomo</i> butted into the swinging doors of a
saloon and disappeared, &#8220;but you remember what I
said about them sheep. How do things look up your
way?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;Feed pretty good?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting awfully dry,&#8221; replied Hardy noncommittally.
&#8220;I suppose your sheep are up on the
Black Mesa by this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ump!&#8221; responded the sheepman, and then there
was a long pause. &#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he said at last, squatting
upon the edge of the sidewalk, &#8220;I want to talk
business with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lit a short black pipe and leaned back comfortably
against a post.</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to be a pretty smooth young feller,&#8221; he
remarked, patronizingly. &#8220;How long have you been
in these parts? Two months, eh? How&#8217;d Judge
Ware come to get a-hold of you?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Just picked me up down at Bender,&#8221; replied
Hardy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, jest picked you up, hey? I thought mebby
you was some kin to him. Ain&#8217;t interested in the
cattle, are you? Well, I jest thought you might be,
being put in over Jeff that way, you know. Nice boy,
that, but hot-headed as a goat. He&#8217;ll be making hair
bridles down in Yuma some day, I reckon. His old
man was the same way. So you ain&#8217;t no kin to the
judge and&#8217;ve got no int&#8217;rest in the cattle, either, eh?
H&#8217;m, how long do you figure on holding down that
job?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Hardy; &#8220;might quit to-day
or get fired to-morrow. It&#8217;s a good place, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the only one, though,&#8221; suggested the sheepman
shrewdly, &#8220;not by a dam&#8217; sight! Ever investigate
the sheep business? No? Then you&#8217;ve overlooked
something! I&#8217;ve lived in this country for nigh
onto twenty years, and followed most every line of
business, but I didn&#8217;t make my pile punching cows,
nor running a store, neither&ndash;&ndash;I made it <i>raising sheep</i>.
Started in with nothing at the time of the big drought
in &#8217;92, herding on shares. Sheep did well in them
good years that followed, and first thing I knew I
was a sheepman. Now I&#8217;ve got forty thousand head,
and I&#8217;m making a hundred per cent on my investment
every year. Of course, if there comes a drought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
I&#8217;ll lose half of &#8217;em, but did you ever sit down and
figure out a hundred per cent a year? Well, five
thousand this year is ten next year, and ten is twenty
the next year, and the twenty looks like forty thousand
dollars at the end of three years. That&#8217;s quite a jag
of money, eh? I won&#8217;t say what it would be in three
years more, but here&#8217;s the point. You&#8217;re a young
man and out to make a stake, I suppose, like the rest
of &#8217;em. What&#8217;s the use of wasting your time and
energy trying to hold that bunch of half-starved cows
together? What&#8217;s the use of going into a <i>poor</i> business,
man, when there&#8217;s a <i>better</i> business; and I&#8217;ll
tell you right now, the sheep business is the coming
industry of Arizona. The sheepmen are going to
own this country, from Flag to the Mexican line, and
you might as well git on the boat, boy, before it&#8217;s too
late.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, as if waiting for his points to sink
home; then he reached out and tapped his listener confidentially
on the knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I like your style. You&#8217;ve got
a head, and you know how to keep your mouth shut.
More&#8217;n that, you don&#8217;t drink. A man like you
could git to be a boss sheep-herder in six months; you
could make a small fortune in three years and never
know you was workin&#8217;. You don&#8217;t need to work,
boy; I kin git a hundred men to work&ndash;&ndash;what I want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
is a man that can <i>think</i>. Now, say, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to need
a man pretty soon&ndash;&ndash;come around and see me some
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Hardy, reluctantly, &#8220;but I might
as well tell you now that I&#8217;m satisfied where I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Satisfied!&#8221; ripped out Swope, with an oath.
&#8220;Satisfied! Why, man alive, you&#8217;re jest hanging on
by your eyebrows up there at Hidden Water! <i>You</i>
haven&#8217;t got nothin&#8217;; you don&#8217;t even own the house
you live in. I could go up there to-morrow and file on
that land and you couldn&#8217;t do a dam&#8217; thing. Judge
Ware thought he was pretty smooth when he euchred
me out of that place, but I want to tell you, boy&ndash;&ndash;and
you can tell him, if you want to&ndash;&ndash;that Old Man Winship
never held no title to that place, and it&#8217;s public
land to-day. That&#8217;s all public land up there; there
ain&#8217;t a foot of land in the Four Peaks country that I
can&#8217;t run my sheep over if I want to, and keep within
my legal rights. So that&#8217;s where you&#8217;re at, Mr.
Hardy, if you want to know!&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped and rammed a cut of tobacco into his
pipe, while Hardy tapped his boot meditatively.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;if that&#8217;s the way things are,
I&#8217;m much obliged to you for not sheeping us out this
Spring. Of course, I haven&#8217;t been in the country
long, and I don&#8217;t know much about these matters, but
I tried to accommodate you all I could, thinking&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t the point,&#8221; broke in Swope, smoking
fiercely, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t threatening ye, and I appreciate your
hospitality&ndash;&ndash;but here&#8217;s the point. What&#8217;s the use of
your monkeying along up there on a job that is sure to
play out, when you can go into a better business?
Answer me that, now!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Hardy only meditated in silence. It was
beyond contemplation that he should hire himself out
as a sheep-herder, but if he said so frankly it might
call down the wrath of Jim Swope upon both him and
the Dos S. So he stood pat and began to fish for
information.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you just think my job is going to play
out,&#8221; he suggested, diplomatically. &#8220;If I&#8217;d go to a
cowman, now, or ask Judge Ware, they might tell me
I had it cinched for life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swope puffed smoke for a minute in a fulminating,
dangerous silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can dead easy answer for that.
Your job, Mr. Hardy, lasts jest as long as I want it
to&ndash;&ndash;and no longer. Now, you can figure that out for
yourself. But I&#8217;d jest like to ask you a question,
since you&#8217;re so smart; how come all us sheepmen
kept off your upper range this year?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Hardy innocently, &#8220;I tried to be
friendly and treated you as white as I could, and I
suppose&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you suppose,&#8221; sneered Swope grimly, &#8220;but
I&#8217;ll jest tell you; we wanted you to hold your job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very kind of you, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; murmured
Hardy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the sheepman sardonically, &#8220;it is&ndash;&ndash;dam&#8217;
kind of us. But now the question is: What ye
goin&#8217; to do about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, in what way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; began Swope, patiently feeling his
way, &#8220;suppose, jest for instance, that some fool Mexican
herder should accidentally get in on your upper
range&ndash;&ndash;would you feel it your duty to put him off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Hardy, hedging, &#8220;I really hadn&#8217;t considered
the matter seriously. Of course, if Judge
Ware&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The judge is in San Francisco,&#8221; put in Swope
curtly. &#8220;Now, suppose that <i>all</i> of us sheepmen should
decide that we wanted some of that good feed up on
Bronco Mesa, and, suppose, furthermore, that we
should all go up there, as we have a perfect legal right
to do, what would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Hardy politely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, supposen I dropped a stick of dynamite
under you,&#8221; burst out Swope hoarsely, &#8220;would you
jump? Speak up, man, you know what I&#8217;m talking
about. You don&#8217;t think you can stand off the whole
Sheepmen&#8217;s Protective Association, do you? Well,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
then, will ye abide by the law and give us our legal
rights or will ye fight like a dam&#8217; fool and git sent to
Yuma for your pains? That&#8217;s what I want to know,
and when you talk to me you talk to the whole Sheepmen&#8217;s
Association, with money enough in its treasury
to send up every cowman in the Four Peaks country!
What I want to know is this&ndash;&ndash;will you fight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might,&#8221; answered Hardy quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you might, hey?&#8221; jeered the sheepman, tapping
his pipe ominously on the sidewalk. &#8220;You
might, he-ey? Well, look at Jeff Creede&ndash;&ndash;<i>he</i> fought&ndash;&ndash;and
what&#8217;s he got to show for it? Look at his old
man&ndash;&ndash;<i>he</i> fought&ndash;&ndash;and where is he now? Tell me
that!</p>
<p>&#8220;But, say, now,&#8221; he exclaimed, changing his tone
abruptly, &#8220;this ain&#8217;t what I started to talk about. I
want to speak with you, Mr. Hardy, on a matter of
business. You jest think them things over until I see
you again&ndash;&ndash;and, of course, all this is on the q. t. But
now let&#8217;s talk business. When you want to buy a
postage stamp you come down here to Moroni, don&#8217;t
you? And why? Why, because it&#8217;s near, sure!
But when you want a wagon-load of grub&ndash;&ndash;and there
ain&#8217;t no one sells provisions cheaper than I do, beans
four-fifty, bacon sixteen cents, flour a dollar-ninety,
everything as reasonable&ndash;&ndash;you haul it clean across the
desert from Bender. That easy adds a cent a pound
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
on every ton you pull, to say nothin&#8217; of the time.
Well, what I want to know is this: Does Einstein sell
you grub that much cheaper? Take flour, for
instance&ndash;&ndash;what does that cost you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Hardy, whose anger was
rising under this unwarranted commercial badgering.
&#8220;Same as with you, I suppose&ndash;&ndash;dollar-ninety.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed Swope triumphantly, &#8220;and the
extra freight on a sack would be fifty cents, wouldn&#8217;t
it&ndash;&ndash;a cent a pound, and a fifty-pound sack! Well,
now say, Hardy, we&#8217;re good friends, you know, and
all that&ndash;&ndash;and Jasp and me steered all them sheep
around you, you recollect&ndash;&ndash;what&#8217;s the matter with
your buying your summer supplies off of me? I&#8217;ll
guarantee to meet any price that Bender Sheeny can
make&ndash;&ndash;and, of course, I&#8217;ll do what&#8217;s right by you&ndash;&ndash;but,
by Joe, I think you owe it to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and waited impatiently for his answer,
but once more Hardy balked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt there&#8217;s a good deal in what you say,
Mr. Swope,&#8221; he said, not without a certain weariness,
&#8220;but you&#8217;ll have to take that matter up with Judge
Ware.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you have the ordering of the supplies?&#8221;
demanded Swope sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but he pays for them. All I do is to order
what I want and O. K. the bills. My credit is good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
with Einstein, and the rate lies between him and
Judge Ware.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, your credit is good here, too,&#8221; replied
Swope acidly, &#8220;but I see you&#8217;d rather trade with a
Jew than stand in with your friends, any day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you I haven&#8217;t got a thing to do with it,&#8221;
replied Hardy warmly. &#8220;I take my orders from
Judge Ware, and if he tells me to trade here I&#8217;ll be
glad to do so&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;ll save me two days&#8217; freighting&ndash;&ndash;but
I&#8217;m not the boss by any means.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, nor you ain&#8217;t much of a supe, neither,&#8221;
growled Swope morosely. &#8220;In fact, I consider you a
dam&#8217; bum supe. Some people, now, after they had
been accommodated, would take a little trouble, but
I notice you ain&#8217;t breaking your back for me. Hell,
no, you don&#8217;t care if I <i>never</i> make a deal. But that&#8217;s
all right, Mr. Hardy, I&#8217;ll try and do as much for you
about that job of yourn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you must think I&#8217;m stuck on that job,&#8221;
cried Hardy hotly, &#8220;the way you talk about it! You
seem to have an idea that if I get let out it&#8217;ll make
some difference to me, but I might as well tell you
right now, Mr. Swope, that it won&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve got a good
horse and I&#8217;ve got money to travel on, and I&#8217;m just
holding this job to accommodate Judge Ware. So
if you have any idea of taking it out on him you can
just say the word and I&#8217;ll quit!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Um-m!&#8221; muttered the sheepman, taken aback by
this sudden burst of temper, &#8220;you&#8217;re a hot-headed
boy, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221; He surveyed him critically in the
half light, as if appraising his value as a fighter, and
then proceeded in a more conciliatory manner. &#8220;But
you mustn&#8217;t let your temper git away with you like
that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re likely to say something
you&#8217;ll be sorry for later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; retorted Hardy. &#8220;It might
relieve my mind some. I&#8217;ve only been in this country
a few months, but if a sheepman is the only man that
has any legal or moral rights I&#8217;d like to know about
it. You talk about coming in on our upper range,
having a right to the whole country, and all that.
Now I&#8217;d like to ask you whether in your opinion a
cowman has got a right to live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, tut, tut, now,&#8221; protested Swope, &#8220;you&#8217;re
gettin&#8217; excited.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course I&#8217;m getting excited,&#8221; replied
Hardy, with feeling. &#8220;You start in by telling me the
sheepmen are going to take the whole country, from
Flag to the line; then you ask me what I&#8217;d do if a
Mexican came in on us; then you say you can sheep
us out any time you want to, and what am I going to
do about it! Is that the way you talk to a man who
has done his best to be your friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never said we was going to sheep you out,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
retorted the sheepman sullenly. &#8220;And if I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217;
thought for a minute you would take on like this about
it I&#8217;d&#8217;ve let you go bust for your postage stamps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you didn&#8217;t <i>say</i> it,&#8221; said Hardy, &#8220;but you
hinted it good and strong, all right. And when a man
comes as near to it as you have I think I&#8217;ve got a right
to ask him straight out what his intentions are. Now
how about it&ndash;&ndash;are you going to sheep us out next Fall
or are you going to give us a chance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh hell!&#8221; burst out Swope, in a mock fury, &#8220;I&#8217;m
never going to talk to <i>you</i> any more! You&#8217;re crazy,
man! <i>I</i> never said I was going to sheep you out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; retorted Hardy dryly, &#8220;and you never said
you wasn&#8217;t, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did, too,&#8221; spat back Swope, seizing at a
straw. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I introduce you to my boss herder
and tell him to keep off your range?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Hardy coldly. &#8220;Did
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment the sheepman sat rigid in the darkness.
Then he rose to his feet, cursing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can jest politely go to hell,&#8221; he said,
with venomous deliberation, and racked off down the
street.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>&#8220;FEED MY SHEEP&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>The slow, monotonous days of Summer crept
listlessly by like dreams which, having neither
beginning nor end, pass away into nothingness, leaving
only a dim memory of restlessness and mystery.</p>
<p>In the relentless heat of noon-day the earth seemed
to shimmer and swim in a radiance of its own; at
evening the sun set in a glory incomparable; and at
dawn it returned to its own. Then in the long
breathless hours the cows sought out the scanty
shadow of the ca&ntilde;on wall, sprawling uneasily in the
sand; the lizards crept far back into the crevices of
the rocks; the birds lingered about the water holes,
throttling their tongues, and all the world took on a
silence that was almost akin to death. As the Summer
rose to its climax a hot wind breathed in from
the desert, clean and pure, but withering in its intensity;
the great bowlders, superheated in the glare of
day, irradiated the stored-up energy of the sun by
night until even the rattlesnakes, their tough hides
scorched through by the burning sands, sought out
their winter dens to wait for a touch of frost. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
was only one creature in all that heat-smitten land
that defied the sway of the Sun-God and went his
way unheeding&ndash;&ndash;man, the indomitable, the conqueror
of mountains and desert and sea.</p>
<p>When the sun was hottest, then was the best time to
pursue the black stallion of Bronco Mesa, chasing
him by circuitous ways to the river where he and his
band could drink. But though more than one fine
mare and suckling, heavy with water, fell victim, the
black stallion, having thought and intelligence like
a man, plunged through the water, leaving his thirst
unquenched, refusing with a continency and steadfastness
rare even among men to sell his liberty at
any price. In the round corral at Hidden Water
there was roping and riding as Creede and Hardy
gentled their prizes; in the cool evenings they rode
forth along the Alamo, counting the cows as they
came down to water or doctoring any that were sick;
and at night they lay on their cots beneath the <i>ramada</i>
telling long stories till they fell asleep.</p>
<p>At intervals of a month or more Hardy rode down
to Moroni and each time he brought back some book
of poems, or a novel, or a bundle of magazines; but
if he received any letters he never mentioned it.
Sometimes he read in the shade, his face sobered to
a scholarly repose, and when the mood came and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
was alone he wrote verses&ndash;&ndash;crude, feverish, unfinished&ndash;&ndash;and
destroyed them, furtively.</p>
<p>He bore his full share of the rough work, whether
riding or horse-breaking or building brush corrals,
but while he responded to every mood of his changeable
companion he hid the whirl of emotion which
possessed him, guarding the secret of his heart even
when writing to Lucy Ware; and slowly, as the
months crept by, the wound healed over and left him
whole.</p>
<p>At last the days grew shorter, the chill came back
into the morning air, and the great thunder-caps
which all Summer had mantled the Peaks, scattering
precarious and insufficient showers across the parching
lowlands, faded away before the fresh breeze from
the coast. Autumn had come, and, though the feed
was scant, Creede started his round-up early, to finish
ahead of the sheep. Out on The Rolls the wild and
runty cows were hiding their newborn calves; the
spring twos were grown to the raw-boned dignity of
steers; and all must be gathered quickly, before the
dust arose in the north and the sheep mowed down
the summer grass. Once more from their distant
ranches the mountain men trailed in behind their
horses; the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> hands dropped in from nowhere,
mysteriously, talking loudly of high adventures but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
with the indisputable marks of Mormon hay-forks on
their thumbs.</p>
<p>Before their restless energy The Rolls were swept
bare of market stock, and the upper end of the mesa
as well, before the first sheep dust showed against the
hills. The <i>rod&eacute;o</i> outfit left Carrizo and came down
to Hidden Water, driving their herd before them, and
still no sheep appeared. So long had they strained
their eyes for nothing that the cowmen from the north
became uneasy, dropping out one by one to return
to their ranches for fear that the sheep had crept in
and laid waste their pastures and corrals. Yet the
round-up ended without a band in sight, where before
The Rolls had been ploughed into channels by their
multitude of feet.</p>
<p>In a slow fever of apprehension Hardy rode ceaselessly
along the rim of Bronco Mesa, without finding
so much as a track. Throughout that long month of
watching and waiting the memory of his conversation
with Jim Swope had haunted him, and with a sinister
boding of impending evil he had ridden far afield,
even to the lower crossing at Pablo Moreno&#8217;s, where
a few Mexicans and Basques were fording the shallow
river. Not one of those veiled threats and intimations
had he confided to Creede, for the orders from
Judge Ware had been for peace and Jeff was hot-headed
and hasty; but in his own mind Hardy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
pictured a solid phalanx of sheep, led by Jasp Swope
and his gun-fighting Chihuahuanos, drifting relentlessly
in over the unravaged mesa. Even that he
could endure, trusting to some appeal or protest to
save him from the ultimate disaster, but the strain of
this ominous waiting was more than Hardy&#8217;s nerves
could stand.</p>
<p>As the town herd was put on the long trail for
Bender and the round-up hands began to spit dry
for their first drink, the premonition of evil conquered
him and he beckoned Creede back out of the rout.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a hunch,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that these sheepmen
are hanging back until you boys are gone, in order to
raid the upper range. I don&#8217;t <i>know</i> anything, you
understand, but I&#8217;m looking for trouble. How does
it look to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered Creede sombrely, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind
tellin&#8217; you that this is a new one on me. It&#8217;s the first
fall gather that I can remember when I didn&#8217;t have a
round-up with a sheepman or two. They&#8217;re willin&#8217;
enough to give us the go-by in the Spring, when
there&#8217;s grass everywhere, but when they come back
over The Rolls in the Fall and see what they&#8217;ve done
to the feed&ndash;&ndash;well, it&#8217;s like fightin&#8217; crows out of a
watermelon patch to protect that upper range.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing I can think of is they may be
held back by this dry weather. But, I tell you,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
Rufe,&#8221; he added, &#8220;it&#8217;s jest as well I&#8217;m goin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;one
man can tell &#8217;em to he&#8217;p themselves as good as two,
and I might get excited. You know your orders&ndash;&ndash;and
I reckon the sheepmen do, too, &#8217;s fer &#8217;s that goes.
They&#8217;re not so slow, if they do git lousy. But my
God, boy, it hurts my feelin&#8217;s to think of you all
alone up here, tryin&#8217; to appeal to Jasp Swope&#8217;s
better nature.&#8221; He twisted his lips, and shrugged
his huge shoulders contemptuously. Then without
enthusiasm he said: &#8220;Well, good luck,&#8221; and rode
away after his cattle.</p>
<p>Creede&#8217;s scorn for this new policy of peace had
never been hidden, although even in his worst cursing
spells he had never quite named the boss. But those
same orders, if they ever became known, would call in
the rapacious sheepmen like vultures to a feast, and
the bones of his cattle&ndash;&ndash;that last sorry remnant of his
father&#8217;s herds&ndash;&ndash;would bleach on Bronco Mesa with
the rest, a mute tribute to the triumph of sheep.</p>
<p>All that day Hardy rode up the Alamo until he
stood upon the summit of the Juate and looked over
the divide to the north, and still there were no sheep.
Not a smoke, not a dust streak, although the chill of
Autumn was in the air. In the distant Sierra Blancas
the snow was already on the peaks and the frosts
lay heavy upon the black mesa of the Mogollons.
Where then could the sheep be, the tender, gently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
nurtured sheep, which could stand neither heat in
Summer nor cold in Winter, but must always travel,
travel, feeding upon the freshest of green grass and
leaving a desert in their wake? The slow-witted
Mexicans and Basques, who did not follow the lead of
the Swopes, had returned on their fall migration with
the regularity of animals, but all those cheery herders
for whom he had cooked and slaved&ndash;&ndash;Bazan, McDonald,
the Swopes and their kin, who used the upper
ford&ndash;&ndash;were lost as if the earth had swallowed them
up.</p>
<p>The stars were shining when Hardy came in sight
of the ranch at the end of that unprofitable day, and
he was tired. The low roof of the house rose up
gloomily before him, but while he was riding in a
hound suddenly raised his challenge in the darkness.
Instantly his yell was answered by a chorus, and as
Chapuli swerved from the rush of the pack the door
was thrown open and the tall, gaunt form of Bill
Johnson stood outlined against the light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yea, Ribs; hey, Rock; down, Ring!&#8221; he hollered.
&#8220;Hey, boys; hey, Suke!&#8221; And in a mighty chorus of
bayings the long-eared hounds circled about and
returned to the feet of their master, wagging their
tails but not abating their barking one whit. Standing
bareheaded in the doorway with his hair and beard
bushed out like a lion&#8217;s mane Johnson strove by kicks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
and curses to quiet their uproar, shouting again and
again some words which Hardy could not catch.</p>
<p>At last, grabbing old Suke, the leader of the pack,
by an ear, he slapped her until her yelpings silenced
the rest; then, stepping out into the opening, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;My God, Hardy, is that you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; replied Hardy impatiently. &#8220;Why,
what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheep!&#8221; shouted Johnson, throwing out his hands
wildly, &#8220;thousands of &#8217;em, millions of &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheep&ndash;&ndash;where?&#8221; demanded Hardy. &#8220;Where are
they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re on your upper range, boy, and more
comin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; cried Hardy incredulously. &#8220;Why, how
did they get up there? I just rode the whole rim
to-day!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They come over the top of the Four Peaks,&#8221;
shouted the old man, shaking with excitement. &#8220;Yes,
sir, over the top of the Four Peaks! My hounds took
after a lion last night, and this mornin&#8217; I trailed &#8217;em
clean over into the middle fork where they had &#8217;im
treed. He jumped down and run when I come up
and jist as we was hotfoot after him we run spang
into three thousand head of sheep, drifting down from
the pass, and six greasers and a white man in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
rear with carbeens. The whole dam&#8217; outfit is comin&#8217;
in on us. But we can turn &#8217;em yet! Whar&#8217;s Jeff
and the boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone to town with the cattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re dished then,&#8221; said the old man
grimly. &#8220;Might as well put up your horse and eat&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; home and see that they don&#8217;t none of &#8217;em
git in on me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose sheep were they?&#8221; inquired Hardy, as he
sat down to a hasty meal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me, boy,&#8221; replied Johnson. &#8220;I never
had time to find out. One of them Mexicans took a
shot at Rye and I pulled my gun on him, and then
the boss herder he jumped in, and there we had it,
back and forth. He claimed I was tryin&#8217; to stompede
his sheep, but I <i>knowed</i> his greaser had tried to shoot
my dog, and I told him so! And I told him furthermore
that the first sheep or sheepman that p&#8217;inted his
head down the Pocket trail would stop lead; and
every one tharafter, as long as I could draw a bead.
And by Gawd, I mean it!&#8221; He struck his gnarled
fist upon the table till every tin plate jumped, and his
fiery eyes burned savagely as he paced about the
room.</p>
<p>At first peep of dawn Bill Johnson was in the
saddle, his long-barrelled revolver thrust pugnaciously
into his boot, his 30-30 carbine across his arm, and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
hounds slouching dutifully along in the rear. Close
behind followed Hardy, bound for the Peaks, but
though the morning was cold he had stripped off his
coat and shaps, and everything which might conceal a
weapon, leaving even his polished Colt&#8217;s in his
blankets. If the sheep were to be turned now it
could never be by arms. The sheepmen had stolen a
march, Creede and his cowboys were far away, and
his only hope was the olive branch of peace. Yet as
he spurred up the Carrizo trail he felt helpless and
abused, like a tried soldier who is sent out unarmed
by a humanitarian commander. Only one weapon
was left to him&ndash;&ndash;the one which even Jim Swope had
noticed&ndash;&ndash;his head; and as he worked along up the
hogback which led down from the shoulder of the
Four Peaks he schooled himself to a Spartan patience
and fortitude.</p>
<p>At last from a high cliff which overshadowed the
broad ca&ntilde;on of the middle fork, he looked down and
saw the sheep, like a huge, dirty-brown blot, pouring
in a hundred diverging lines down the valley and
feeding as they came. Higher and higher up the
sides the old ewes fought their way, plucking at the
long spears of grass which grew among the rocks; and
the advance guard, hurrying forward, nipped eagerly
at the browse and foliage as they passed, until, at last,
some tempting bush detained them too long and they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
were swallowed up in the ruck. Little paths appeared
in the leaders&#8217; wake, winding in and out among
the bowlders; and like soldiers the sheep fell into line,
moving forward with the orderly precision of an
army. A herder with his dogs trailed nonchalantly
along the flank, the sun glinting from his carbine as
he clambered over rocks, and in the rear another silent
shepherd followed up the drag. So far it was a
peaceful pastoral scene, but behind the herd where the
camp rustler and his burros should have been there
was a posse of men, and each man carried a gun.</p>
<p>Hardly had Chapuli mounted the ridge before
every head was raised; the swarthy Mexicans unslung
their guns with a flourish, and held them at a ready.
Yet for half an hour the lone horseman sat there like
a statue, and if he resented their coming or saw the
dust of other bands behind, he made no sign. Even
when the guard of men passed beneath him, craning
their necks uneasily, he still remained silent and immobile,
like a man who has councils of his own or
leads a force behind.</p>
<p>The leader of the vanguard of the sheep was a
white man, and not unversed in the principles of
war, for after trailing safely through the box of the
ca&ntilde;on&ndash;&ndash;where a single rock displaced would kill a
score of sheep, and where the lone horseman had he
so willed could have potted half of the invaders from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
the heights&ndash;&ndash;he turned his herd up a side ca&ntilde;on to
the west and hastily pitched his camp on a ridge.
As the heat of the day came on, the other bands up the
ca&ntilde;on stopped also, and when the faint smoke showed
Hardy that the camp rustlers were cooking dinner,
he turned and rode for the leader&#8217;s camp.</p>
<p>Dinner was already served&ndash;&ndash;beans, fried mutton,
and bread, spread upon a greasy canvas&ndash;&ndash;and the
hungry herders were shovelling it down with knives
in their own primitive way when Hardy rode up the
slope. As he came into camp the Chihuahuanos
dropped their plates, reached for their guns, and stood
in awkward postures of defence, some wagging their
big heads in a braggartly defiance, others, their courage
waning, grinning in the natural shame of the
peasant. In Hardy they recognized a gentleman of
<i>categor&iacute;a</i>&ndash;&ndash;and he never so much as glanced at them
as he reined in his spirited horse. His eyes were fixed
upon the lone white man, their commander, who stood
by the fire regarding him with cold suspicion, and to
whom he bowed distantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; he said, by way of introduction,
and the sheepman blinked his eyes in reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose sheep are those?&#8221; continued Hardy, coming
to the point with masterful directness, and once
more the boss sheepman surveyed him with suspicion.</p>

<img src='images/illus-177.jpg' alt='' title='' width='395' height='633' /><br />
<p class='caption'>
&#8220;Put up them guns, you gawky fools! This man ain&#8217;t going to eat ye!&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Mine,&#8221; he said, and Hardy returned his stare with
a glance which, while decorously veiled, indicated that
he knew he lied. The man was a stranger to him,
rather tall and slender, with drawn lips and an eye
that never wavered. His voice was tense with excitement
and he kept his right thumb hooked carelessly
into the corner of his pocket, not far from the grip
of a revolver. As soon as he spoke Hardy knew
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are Mr. Thomas, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; he inquired,
as if he had no thought of trouble. &#8220;I believe I met
you once, down in Moroni.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ump!&#8221; grunted Mr. Thomas unsociably, and at
that moment one of the Mexicans, out of awkwardness,
dropped his gun. As he stooped to pick it up
a slow smile crept over the cowman&#8217;s lips, a smile
which expressed polite amusement along with a
measured contempt&ndash;&ndash;and the boss herder was stung
with a nameless shame at the false play.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put up them guns, you dam&#8217; gawky fools!&#8221; he
yelled in a frenzy of rage. &#8220;Put &#8217;em up, I say. This
man ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to eat ye!&#8221; And though the poor
browbeaten Chihuahuanos understood not a word of
English they felt somehow that they had been overzealous
and shuffled back to their blankets, like watchdogs
that had been rebuked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the sheepman, taking his hand from
his gun, &#8220;what can I do for you, Mr. Hardy?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; responded Hardy, &#8220;of course there are
several things you <i>might</i> do to accommodate me, but
maybe you wouldn&#8217;t mind telling me how you got
in here, just for instance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always glad to &#8217;commodate&ndash;&ndash;where I can, of
course,&#8221; returned the sheepman grimly. &#8220;I came in
over the top of them Four Peaks yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um,&#8221; said Hardy, glancing up at the rocky walls.
&#8220;Then you must&#8217;ve had hooks on your eyebrows, for
sure. I suppose the rest of the family is coming, too!
And, by the way, how is my friend, Mr. Swope?&#8221;</p>
<p>He appended this last with an artless smile, quite
lacking in bitterness, but somehow the boss herder felt
himself discredited by the inquiry, as if he were consorting
with thieves. It was the old shame of the
sheepman, the shame which comes to the social outcast,
and burns upon the cheek of the dishonored
bastard, but which is seared deepest into the heart
of the friendless herder, the Ishmaelite of the cow-country,
whose hand is against every man and every
man&#8217;s against him. Hunger and thirst he can
endure, and the weariness of life, but to have all men
turn away from him, to answer him grudgingly, to
feed him at their table, but refuse themselves to eat,
this it is which turns his heart to bitterness and makes
him a man to be feared. As Thomas had looked at
this trim young cowboy, smooth-shaven and erect, sitting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
astride a blooded horse which snorted and pawed
the ground delicately, and then had glanced at the
low and brutal Mexicans with whom his lot was cast,
a blind fury had swept over him, wreaking its force
upon his own retainers; and now, when by implication
he was classed with Jim Swope, he resented it
still more bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dam&#8217;fino,&#8221; he answered sullenly. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t seen
&#8217;im for a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t he with you this trip?&#8221; asked Hardy, in
surprise. &#8220;I had hoped that I might find him up
here.&#8221; There was a suggestion of irony in his words
which was not lost upon the <i>mayordomo</i>, but Thomas
let the remark pass in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps his brother Jasper is along,&#8221; ventured
Hardy. &#8220;No? Well, that&#8217;s Jim&#8217;s earmark on
those sheep, and I know it. What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Matter with what?&#8221; growled Thomas morosely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, with Jim, of course. I thought after the
pleasant times we had together last Spring he&#8217;d be
sure to come around. In fact,&#8221; he added meaningly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this naive statement, the sheepman could not
restrain a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know Jim as well as I do,&#8221; he said, and
there was a suggestion of bitterness in his voice which
Hardy was not slow to note.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps not,&#8221; he allowed; &#8220;but you know,
and I know, that this is no pleasure trip you&#8217;re on&ndash;&ndash;in
fact, it&#8217;s dangerous, and I never thought that Jim
Swope would send a man where he was afraid to go
himself. Now I&#8217;ve got nothing against you, Mr.
Thomas, and of course you&#8217;re working for him; but I
ask you, as a man, don&#8217;t you think, after what I&#8217;ve
done for him, that Jim Swope ought to come along
himself if he wants to sheep me out?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve fed him, and I&#8217;ve fed all his herders and all
his friends; I&#8217;ve grained his horses when they were
ga&#8217;nted down to a shadow because his own sheep had
cleaned up the feed; I&#8217;ve made him welcome to my
house and done everything I could for him; and all I
asked in return was that he would respect this upper
range. He knows very well that if his sheep go
through here this Fall our cattle will die in the
Winter, and he knows that there is plenty of feed out
on The Rolls where our cows can&#8217;t go, and yet he
sends you in where he&#8217;s scared to go himself, just
to hog our last piece of good feed and to put us
out of business. I asked him down in Moroni if he
thought a cowman had a right to live, and he dodged
the question as if he was afraid he&#8217;d say something.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly and looked out over the
country toward Hidden Water, while the Mexicans
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
watched him furtively from beneath their slouched
hats.</p>
<p>&#8220;Expecting some friends?&#8221; inquired Thomas, with
a saturnine grin.</p>
<p>Hardy shook his head. &#8220;No. I came out here
alone, and I left my gun in camp. I haven&#8217;t got a
friend within forty miles, if that&#8217;s what you mean. I
suppose you&#8217;ve got your orders, Mr. Thomas, but I
just want to talk this matter over with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the sheepman, suddenly thawing
out at the good news. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have so much company
as to make me refuse, even if it is a warm
subject. But mebby you&#8217;d like a bite to eat before
we git down to business?&#8221; He waved a deprecating
hand at the greasy canvas, and Hardy swung quickly
down from his saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. But don&#8217;t let me keep you from your
dinner. Here&#8217;s where I break even with Jim
Swope for all that grub I cooked last Spring,&#8221; he remarked,
as he filled his plate. &#8220;But if it was him that
asked me,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I&#8217;d starve to death before I&#8217;d
eat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat on his heels by the canvas, with the boss
sheepman on the other side, and the Mexicans who
had been so cocky took their plates and retired like
Apaches to the edge of the brush, where they would
not obtrude upon their betters.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></div>
<p>&#8220;They say it&#8217;s bad for the digestion,&#8221; observed
Hardy, after the first silence, &#8220;to talk about things
that make you mad; so if you don&#8217;t mind, Mr.
Thomas, we&#8217;ll forget about Jim Swope. What kind
of a country is it up there in Apache County, where
you keep your sheep all Summer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A fine country,&#8221; rejoined Thomas, &#8220;and I wish
to God I was back to it,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter with this country? It
looks pretty good to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-es,&#8221; admitted the sheepman grudgingly, &#8220;it
looks good enough, but&ndash;&ndash;well, I lived up there a long
time and I got to like it. I had one of the nicest
little ranches in the White Mountains; there was good
huntin&#8217; and fishin&#8217; and&ndash;&ndash;well, I felt like a white man
up there&ndash;&ndash;never had no trouble, you understand&ndash;&ndash;and
I was makin&#8217; good money, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice, which before had been harsh and strident,
softened down as he dwelt upon the natural beauty of
the mountains which had been his home, but there was
a tone of sadness in his talk which told Hardy that
ultimately he had suffered some great misfortune
there. His occupation alone suggested that&ndash;&ndash;for
there are few white men working as sheep-herders who
lack a hard luck story, if any one will listen to it. But
this Shep Thomas was still young and unbroken, with
none of the black marks of dissipation upon his face,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
and his eyes were as keen and steady as any hunter&#8217;s.
He was indeed the very type of fighter that Swope
had sought, hardy and fearless, and at the same time
careful. As they sat together Hardy looked him over
and was glad that he had come out unarmed, yet
though his host seemed a man of just and reasonable
mind there was a set, dogged look in his eyes which
warned the cowman not to interfere, but let him talk
his fill. And the boss herder, poor lonely man, was
carried away in spite of himself by the temptation of
a listener; after many days of strife and turmoil,
cutting trails, standing off cowmen, cursing Mexicans,
at last to meet a white man who would just sit silent
and let him talk! His stories were of hunting and
fishing, of prospecting, and restless adventures among
the Indians, and every time the conversation worked
around towards sheep he led it resolutely away. And
for his part, never for a moment did Hardy try to
crowd him, but let the talk lead where it would, until
of his own volition the sheepman told his story.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you wonder what I&#8217;m doing down
here,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;if I was so stuck on the Concho
country? Well, I bet you wouldn&#8217;t guess in a thousand
years&ndash;&ndash;and you ought to be a pretty good
guesser, too,&#8221; he added, with a gruff laugh. &#8220;Now,
what do you think it was that put me on the bum?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poker game?&#8221; queried Hardy politely.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; replied the sheepman, showing his teeth,
&#8220;I&#8217;m winners on poker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look like a drinking man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naw&ndash;&ndash;nor it wasn&#8217;t women, either. It&#8217;s something
unusual, I tell you. I stood and looked at it
for ten years, and never turned a hair. But here,
I&#8217;ve been holdin&#8217; out on you a little&ndash;&ndash;I never told you
what it was I raised on my ranch. Well, it was
sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheep?&#8221; echoed Hardy, &#8220;did you keep &#8217;em there
all Winter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y sure, man. There&#8217;s lots of sheep in Apache
County that was never ten miles from home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why does Jim Swope bring his bands south
every Fall? I hear he loses five per cent of them, at
the least, coming and going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you don&#8217;t understand Jim as well as I do. I
was tryin&#8217; to make a livin&#8217;; he&#8217;s tryin&#8217; to git rich.
He&#8217;s doin&#8217; it, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more the note of bitterness came into his voice,
and Hardy saw that the time had come.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; he inquired quietly, and the sheepman
plunged into his story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it was this way. I kept a few thousand
sheep up there in my valley. In the Summer we went
up the mountain, followin&#8217; the grass, and in the Winter
we fed down below, where the ground was bare.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
It never got very cold, and my sheep was used to it,
anyhow. The Navajos don&#8217;t move their sheep south,
do they? Well, they&#8217;re away north of where I was.
We jest give &#8217;em a little shelter, and looked after &#8217;em,
and, as I says, I was doin&#8217; fine&ndash;&ndash;up to last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused again, with his secret on his lips, and
once more Hardy supplied the helping word.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what happened then?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened then?&#8221; cried Thomas, his eyes
burning. &#8220;Well, <i>you</i> ought to know&ndash;&ndash;I was sheeped
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheeped out? Why, how could that happen?
You were a sheepman yourself!&#8221;</p>
<p>The boss herder contemplated him with an amused
and cynical smile. &#8220;You ask Jim Swope,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>For a minute Hardy sat staring at him, bewildered.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;<i>I</i> can&#8217;t figure it out&ndash;&ndash;maybe you
wouldn&#8217;t mind telling me how it happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why hell, man,&#8221; burst out the sheepman, &#8220;it&#8217;s
as plain as the nose on your face&ndash;&ndash;I didn&#8217;t belong to
the Association. All these big sheepmen that drive
north and south belong to the Sheepmen&#8217;s Protective
Association, and they stand in with each other, but we
little fellows up in &#8217;Pache County was nobody. It&#8217;s
about ten years ago now that the Swope outfit first
came in through our country; and, bein&#8217; in the sheep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
business ourselves, we was always friendly, and never
made no trouble, and naturally supposed that they&#8217;d
respect our range. And so they did, until I found
one of Jim&#8217;s herders in on my ranch last Summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I thought there was some misunderstandin&#8217;,
but when I told him and his <i>compadres</i> to move it was
a bad case of &#8216;No savvy&#8217; from the start; and while I
was monkeyin&#8217; around with them a couple of more
bands sneaked in behind, and first thing I knew my
whole lower range was skinned clean. Well, sir, I
worked over one of them <i>paisanos</i> until he was a
total wreck, and I took a shot at another <i>hombre</i>,
too&ndash;&ndash;the one that couldn&#8217;t savvy; but there was
no use cavin&#8217; round about it&ndash;&ndash;I was jest naturally
sheeped out.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looked like I was busted, but I wouldn&#8217;t admit
it, and while I was studyin&#8217; on the matter along comes
Jim himself and offers me five thousand dollars for
my sheep. They was worth ten if they was worth a
cent, all fine and fat; but my winter feed was gone
and of course I was up against it. I see somethin&#8217;
would have to be done, and dam&#8217; quick, too; so I
chased down to St. John and tried to git a higher bid.
But these sheepmen stand in with each other on a
proposition like that, and I couldn&#8217;t git nawthin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;All right,&#8217; I says to Jim, &#8216;take &#8217;em, and be
dam&#8217;ed to you.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The price has gone down,&#8217; says Jim. &#8216;I&#8217;ll give
you four thousand.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>What!</i>&#8217; I says.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Three thousand,&#8217; says Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;ll give me <i>five</i> thousand,&#8217; says I, crowdin&#8217;
my gun against his short ribs, &#8216;or I&#8217;ll let the light in
on you,&#8217; and after that Jim and me understood each
other perfectly. In fact, we got stuck on each other.
Yes, sir, after I got over bein&#8217; excited and could listen
to reason, he put it to me straight&ndash;&ndash;and he was right.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What&#8217;s the use of bein&#8217; the yaller dog?&#8217; he says.
&#8216;You can&#8217;t buck the whole Association. But we&#8217;ve
got room for you,&#8217; he says, &#8216;so git on and ride.&#8217; And
here I am, by Joe, leadin&#8217; the procession.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheepman paused and gazed at the band of
sheep as they stood in a solid mass, their heads tucked
under each other&#8217;s bellies to escape the sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them sheep used to be mine,&#8221; he observed,
and laughed slyly. &#8220;That&#8217;s the only thing between
me and the boss. He&#8217;s begged and implored, and
cursed and said his prayers, tryin&#8217; to git me interested
in the sheep business again; but like the pore, dam&#8217;
fool I am I keep that five thousand dollars in the
bank.&#8221; His shoulders heaved for a moment with
silent laughter, and then his face turned grave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Hardy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;business is business,
and I&#8217;ve got to be movin&#8217; along pretty soon. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
believe you said you&#8217;d like to talk matters over for a
minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Hardy promptly, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to
make arrangements to have you turn out through that
pass yonder and leave us a little feed for next
Winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheepman cocked his head to one side and shut
one eye knowingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you would, would you? And what word shall
I take back to the boss, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect I&#8217;ll see him before you do,&#8221; said Hardy,
&#8220;but if you get ahead of me you can just say that I
asked you to move, and so you followed out your
orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; responded Thomas, smiling satirically,
&#8220;that&#8217;d be lovely. But how long since I&#8217;ve been
takin&#8217; orders off of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not trying to give you any orders,&#8221; protested
Hardy. &#8220;Those come straight from Jim
Swope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; inquired the sheepman, with sudden
interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, don&#8217;t you remember what he said when he
introduced me to you, down in Moroni? &#8216;This is Mr.
Hardy,&#8217; he said, &#8216;a white cowman. If you have to go
across his range, go quick, and tell your men the
same.&#8217; You may have forgotten, but it made a great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
impression on me. And then, to show there was no
mistake about it, he told me if I found any of his
sheep on my range to order them off, and you would
see that they went. Isn&#8217;t that straight?&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaned over and looked the sheepman in the eye
but Thomas met his glance with a sardonic smile.
&#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s right. But I&#8217;ve received other orders
since then. You know Jim claims to be religious&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s
one of the elders in the church down there&ndash;&ndash;and
he likes to keep his word good. After you was
gone he come around to me and said: &#8216;That&#8217;s all
right, Shep, about what I said to that cowman, but
there&#8217;s one thing I want you always to remember&ndash;&ndash;feed
my sheep!&#8217; Well, them&#8217;s my orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; commented Hardy, &#8220;that may be good
Scripture, but what about my cows? There&#8217;s plenty
of feed out on The Rolls for Jim&#8217;s sheep, but
my cows have got to drink. We cowmen have
been sheeped out of all the lower country down
there, and here we are, crowded clear up against
the rocks. You&#8217;ve stolen a march on us and of
course you&#8217;re entitled to some feed, but give us a
chance. You&#8217;ve been sheeped out yourself, and you
know what it feels like. Now all I ask of you is that
you turn out through this pass and go down onto The
Rolls. If you&#8217;ll do that I can turn all the rest of
the sheep and keep my cows from starving, but if you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
go through me they&#8217;ll all go through me, and I&#8217;m
done for. I don&#8217;t make any threats and I can&#8217;t offer
any inducements, but I just ask you, as a white
man, to go around.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he ended his appeal he stood with his hands
thrown out, and the sheepman looked at him, smiling
curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, at last, &#8220;you&#8217;re a new kind of
cowman on me, pardner, but I&#8217;ll go you, if Jim
throws a fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>He advanced, and held out his hand, and Hardy
took it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If all sheepmen were like you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;life would
be worth living in these parts.&#8221; And so, in a friendship
unparalleled in the history of the Four Peaks
country, a sheepman and a cowman parted in amity&ndash;&ndash;and
the sheep went around.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>JUMPED</h3>
</div>
<p>Winter, the wonted season of torrential rains,
six weeks&#8217; grass, and budding flowers, when the
desert is green and the sky washed clean and blue, followed
close in the wake of the sheep, which went drifting
past Hidden Water like an army without banners.
But alas for Hidden Water and the army of sheep!&ndash;&ndash;in
this barren Winter the torrential rains did not
fall, the grass did not sprout, and the flowers did not
bloom. A bleak north wind came down from the
mountains, cold and dry and crackling with electricity,
and when it had blown its stint it died down in a freezing,
dusty silence.</p>
<p>Then the mighty south&ndash;&ndash;the rain&ndash;&ndash;wind that blows
up out of Papaguer&iacute;a, rose up, big with promise, and
whirled its dust clouds a thousand feet high against
the horizon. But, after much labor, the keen, steely,
north wind rushed suddenly down upon the black
clouds, from whose edges the first spatter of rain had
already spilled, and swept them from the horizon,
howling mournfully the while and wrestling with the
gaunt trees at night. In shaded places the icicles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
from slow-seeping waters clung for days unmelted,
and the migrant ducks, down from the Arctic, rose
up from the half-frozen sloughs and winged silently
away to the far south. Yet through it all the Dos S
cattle came out unscathed, feeding on what dry grass
and browse the sheep had left on Bronco Mesa; and in
the Spring, when all hope seemed past, it rained.</p>
<p>Only those who have been through a drought know
what music there is hidden in rain. It puts a wild
joy into the heart of every creature, the birds sing,
the rabbits leap and caper, and all the cattle and wild
horses take to roaming and wandering out of pure
excess of spirits. It was early in March when the
first showers came, and as soon as the new feed was
up Creede began his preparations for the spring
<i>rod&eacute;o</i>. The Winter had been a hard one, and not
without its worries. In an interview, which tended
on both sides to become heated and personal, Jim
Swope had denounced Hardy for misrepresenting his
orders to his <i>mayordomo</i>, and had stated in no uncertain
terms his firm intention of breaking even in the
Spring, if there was a blade of grass left on the upper
range.</p>
<p>The season had been a bad one for his sheep, windy
and cold, with sand storms which buried the desert in
a pall and drove many flocks to the hills; and as the
feed became shorter and shorter vagrant bands began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
to drift in along the Salagua. In the battle for the
range that followed herders and punchers greeted each
other with angry snarls which grew more wolfish every
day, and old Pablo Moreno, shaking his white head
over their quarrels, uttered gloomy prophecies of
greater evils to come. Sheep would die, he said, cattle
would die&ndash;&ndash;it was only a question now of how many,
and of which. It was a coming <i>a&ntilde;o seco</i>; nay, the
whole country was drying up. In Hermosillo, so they
said, the women stood by the public well all night,
waiting to fill their <i>ollas</i>; not for nine years had the
rains fallen there, and now the drought was spreading
north. Arizona, California, Nevada, all were
doomed, yet <i>paciencia</i>, perhaps&ndash;&ndash;and then came the
rain. Yes, it was a good rain but&ndash;&ndash;and then it rained
again. <i>Que bueno</i>, who would not be made a liar for
rain? But <i>cuidado</i>&ndash;&ndash;behold, the ground was still dry;
it drank up the water as it fell and was thirsty again;
the river fell lower and lower and the water was
clear; a bad sign, a very bad sign!</p>
<p>But if the young should wait upon the advice of
the old there would be no more miracles. Creede and
Hardy passed up the weather, strapped on their six-shooters,
and began to patrol the range, &#8220;talking
reason&#8221; to the stray Mexicans who thought that,
because their sheep were getting poor, they ought to
move them to better feed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>The time for friendship and diplomacy was past, as
Hardy politely informed his employer by letter&ndash;&ndash;after
which he told Rafael to keep away from the
post office and not bring him any more <i>corr&eacute;o</i>, if he
valued his job. But though he had made his note to
Judge Ware brief, it had said too much. He had
suggested that if the judge did not like his change of
policy he had better come down and see the actual
conditions for himself&ndash;&ndash;and the old judge came.</p>
<p>It was midafternoon of that fateful day when
Creede and Hardy, riding in from up the river, saw
Rafael&#8217;s wagon in front of the house. This was not
surprising in itself as he had been down to Bender for
round-up supplies, but as the two partners approached
the house Creede suddenly grabbed Hardy&#8217;s
rein and drew back as if he were on top of a rattlesnake.</p>
<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what&#8217;s that? Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>He jerked a thumb toward the house, and in the
tense silence Hardy could clearly discern the sound
of women&#8217;s voices. Now you could ride the Four
Peaks country far and wide and never hear the music
of such voices, never see calico on the line, or a lace
curtain across the window. There were no women in
that godless land, not since the Widow Winship took
Sallie and Susie and left precipitately for St. Louis,
none save the Se&ntilde;ora Moreno and certain strapping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
Apache squaws who wore buckskin <i>t&eacute;was</i> and carried
butcher knives in their belts. Even the heart of
Rufus Hardy went pit-a-pat and stopped, at the
sound of that happy chatter.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re rustlin&#8217; the whole dam&#8217; house,&#8221; exclaimed
Creede, all nerves and excitement. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear
that pan go &#8216;bamp&#8217;? Say, I believe they&#8217;re cleanin&#8217;
house! Rufe,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;I bet you money we&#8217;re
jumped!&#8221;</p>
<p>The possibility of having their ranch pre&euml;mpted
during their absence had been spoken of in a general
way, since Jim Swope had gone on the warpath, but
in his secret soul Rufus Hardy had a presentiment
which made claim-jumping look tame. There was a
chastened gayety in the voices, a silvery ripple in the
laughter, which told him what Creede with all his
cunning could never guess; they were voices from
another world, a world where Hardy had had trouble
and sorrow enough, and which he had left forever.
There was soldier blood in his veins and in two eventful
years he had never weakened; but the suddenness
of this assault stampeded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You better go first, Jeff,&#8221; he said, turning his horse
away, &#8220;they might&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Creede was quick to intercept him.</p>
<p>&#8220;None o&#8217; that, now, pardner,&#8221; he said, catching his
rein. &#8220;You&#8217;re parlor-broke&ndash;&ndash;go on ahead!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></div>
<p>There was a wild, uneasy stare in his eye, which
nevertheless meant business, and Hardy accepted the
rebuke meekly. Perhaps his conscience was already
beginning to get action for the subterfuge and deceit
which he had practised during their year together.
He sat still for a moment, listening to the voices and
smiling strangely.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, brother,&#8221; he said, in his old quiet way,
and then, whirling Chapuli about, he galloped up to
the house, sitting him as straight and resolute as any
soldier. But Creede jogged along more slowly, tucking
in his shirt, patting down his hair, and wiping the
sweat from his brow.</p>
<p>At the thud of hoofs a woman&#8217;s face appeared at
the doorway&ndash;&ndash;a face sweet and innocent, with a broad
brow from which the fair hair was brushed evenly
back, and eyes which looked wonderingly out at the
world through polished glasses. It was Lucy Ware,
and when Hardy saw her he leaped lightly from his
horse and advanced with hat in hand&ndash;&ndash;smiling, yet
looking beyond her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad to see you, Miss Lucy,&#8221; he said, as he
took her hand, &#8220;and if we had only known you were
coming&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Rufus Hardy!&#8221; exclaimed the young lady,
&#8220;do you mean to say you never received <i>any</i> of my
letters?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>At this Creede stared, and in that self-same moment
Hardy realized how the low-down strategy which he
had perpetrated upon his employer had fallen upon his
own head a thousandfold. But before he could
stammer his apologies, Kitty Bonnair stood before
him&ndash;&ndash;the same Kitty, and smiling as he had often
seen her in his dreams.</p>
<p>She was attired in a stunning outing suit of officer&#8217;s
cloth, tailored for service, yet bringing out the graceful
lines of her figure; and as Hardy mumbled out
his greetings the eyes of Jefferson Creede, so long
denied of womankind, dwelt eagerly upon her beauty.
Her dainty feet, encased in tan high boots, held him
in rapt astonishment; her hands fascinated him with
their movements like the subtle turns of a mesmerist;
and the witchery of her supple body, the mischief in
the dark eyes, and the teasing sweetness of her voice
smote him to the heart before he was so much as
noticed.</p>
<p>No less absolute, for all his strivings, was the conquest
of Rufus Hardy, the frozen bulwarks of whose
heart burst suddenly and went out like spring ice in
the radiance of her first smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d be glad to see me, too,&#8221; she said,
holding out her hand to him; and forgetful of all his
bitterness he grasped it warmly. Then, tardily conscious
of his duty, he turned to Jeff.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Miss Kitty,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is my friend, Jefferson
Creede&ndash;&ndash;Miss Bonnair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to meet you, Mr. Creede,&#8221; said Kitty,
bestowing her hand upon the embarrassed cowboy.
&#8220;Of course you know Miss Ware!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy do, Miss,&#8221; responded Creede, fumbling
for his hat, and as Miss Lucy took his hand the man
who had put the fear of God into the hearts of so
many sheep-herders became dumb and tongue-tied
with bashfulness. There was not a man in the Four
Peaks country that could best him, in anger or in jest,
when it called for the ready word; but Kitty Bonnair
had so stolen his wits that he could only stand and
sweat like a trick-broken horse. As for Hardy he
saw rainbows and his heart had gone out of business,
but still he was &#8220;parlor-broke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid you didn&#8217;t find the house very
orderly,&#8221; he observed, as Creede backed off and the
conversation sagged; and the two girls glanced at
each other guiltily. &#8220;Of course you&#8217;re just as welcome,&#8221;
he added hastily, &#8220;and I suppose you couldn&#8217;t
help cleaning house a bit; but you gave us both a bad
scare, all the same. Didn&#8217;t you notice how pale we
looked?&#8221; he asked, to mask his embarrassment. &#8220;But
you were right, Jeff,&#8221; he continued enigmatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he always defer to you that way, Mr.
Creede?&#8221; inquired Kitty Bonnair, with an engaging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
smile. &#8220;<i>We</i> used to find him rather perverse.&#8221; She
glanced roguishly at Hardy as she gave this veiled
rebuke. &#8220;But what was it that you were right about?&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
just dying to ask you questions!&#8221;</p>
<p>She confessed this with a naive frankness which
quite won the big cowboy&#8217;s heart, and, his nerve coming
back, he grinned broadly at his former suspicions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I might as well come through with
it&ndash;&ndash;I told him I bet we&#8217;d been jumped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jumped?&#8221; repeated Miss Kitty, mystified. &#8220;Oh,
is that one of your cowboy words? Tell me what it
means!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y, it means,&#8221; drawled Creede, &#8220;that two young
fellers like me and Rufe goes out to ride the range
and when we come back some other outfit has moved
into our happy home and we&#8217;re orphans. We&#8217;ve
been havin&#8217; a little trouble with the sheep lately, and
when I heard them pots and kittles rattlin&#8217; around in
here I thought for sure some Mormon sheepman had
got the jump on us and located the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what would you have done if he had?&#8221; continued
Kitty eagerly. &#8220;Would you have shot him
with that big pistol?&#8221; She pointed to the heavy
Colt&#8217;s which Creede had slung on his hip.</p>
<p>But this was getting too romantic and Western,
even for Jeff. &#8220;No, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said modestly. &#8220;We
just carry that to balance us in the saddle.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed Kitty, disappointed, &#8220;and didn&#8217;t
you ever shoot <i>anybody</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>Creede blushed for her, in spite of himself.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied evasively, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how it
would be up where you come from, but that&#8217;s kind
of a leadin&#8217; question, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you have, then!&#8221; exclaimed Kitty Bonnair
ecstatically. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad to see a really, truly
cowboy!&#8221; She paused, and gazed up at him soulfully.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you let me have it for a minute?&#8221;
she pleaded, and with a sheepish grin Creede handed
over his gun.</p>
<p>But if there had been another cowboy within a mile
he would have hesitated, infatuated as he was.
Every land has its symbolism and though the
language of flowers has not struck root in the cow
country&ndash;&ndash;nor yet the amorous Mexican system of
&#8220;playing the bear&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;to give up one&#8217;s pistol to a lady
is the sign and token of surrender. However, though
it brought the sweat to his brow, the byplay was
pulled off unnoticed, Hardy and Lucy Ware being
likewise deep in confidences.</p>
<p>&#8220;How strange you look, Rufus!&#8221; exclaimed Lucy,
as Kitty Bonnair began her assault upon the happiness
of Jefferson Creede. &#8220;What have you been
doing to yourself in these two years?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, nothing,&#8221; protested Hardy, a little wan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
from his encounter with Kitty. &#8220;Perhaps you have
forgotten how I used to look&ndash;&ndash;our hair gets pretty
long up here,&#8221; he added apologetically, &#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Lucy firmly. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t a matter of
hair, although I will admit I hardly knew you. It&#8217;s
in your eyes; and you have some stern, hard lines
about your mouth, too. Father says you spend all
your time trying to keep the sheep out&ndash;&ndash;and he&#8217;s
very much displeased with you for disobeying his
directions, too. He gave up some important business
to come down here and see you, and I hope he
scolds you well. Have you been writing any lately?&#8221;
she asked accusingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; answered Hardy absently, &#8220;we don&#8217;t have to
<i>fight</i> them&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Rufus,&#8221; protested Lucy Ware, laying her
hand on his arm, &#8220;do take your mind from those
dreadful sheep. I asked you if you have been doing
any <i>writing</i> lately&ndash;&ndash;you promised to send me some
poems, don&#8217;t you remember? And I haven&#8217;t received
a thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Hardy, blushing at his mistake.
&#8220;Well, I acknowledge that I haven&#8217;t done right&ndash;&ndash;and
you have been very kind, too, Miss Lucy,&#8221; he
added gently. &#8220;But somehow I never finish anything
down here&ndash;&ndash;and the sheep have been pretty
bad lately. I have to do my work first, you know.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
I&#8217;ll tell you, though,&#8221; he said, lowering his voice
confidentially, &#8220;if I can see you when no one is around
I&#8217;ll give you what little I&#8217;ve written&ndash;&ndash;at least, some
of the best. A poet at his worst, you know,&#8221; he
added, smiling, &#8220;is the poorest man in the world.
He&#8217;s like a woman who tells everything&ndash;&ndash;no one
could respect him. But if we can take our finer
moods, and kind of sublimate them, you know, well&ndash;&ndash;every
man is a poet some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hesitated, ended lamely, and fell suddenly into
a settled silence. The hard lines about his lips deepened;
his eyes, cast to the ground, glowed dully; and
in every feature Lucy read the despair that was
gnawing at his heart. And with it there was something
more&ndash;&ndash;a tacit rebuke to her for having brought
Kitty there to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have missed you very much,&#8221; she began softly,
as if reading his thoughts, &#8220;and your letters were so
interesting! Ever since I showed Kitty the first one
she has been crazy to come down here. Yes, she has
been reading &#8216;The Virginian&#8217; and O. Henry and
&#8216;Wolfville&#8217; until it is simply awful to hear her talk.
And ride&ndash;&ndash;she has been taking lessons for a year!
Her saddle is out there now in the wagon, and if
she could have caught one of those wild horses out
in that inclosed field I really believe she would have
mounted him and taken to the hills like an Indian.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
I had to come down to take care of father, you know,
and&ndash;&ndash;aren&#8217;t you glad to see us, Rufus?&#8221;</p>
<p>She gazed up at him anxiously, and her eyes became
misty as she spoke; but Hardy was far away and he
did not see.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said absently, &#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;I shall be very
busy. Oh, where is your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>A light went suddenly from Lucy&#8217;s eyes and her
lips quivered, but her voice was as steady as ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has gone down to the river,&#8221; she said patiently.
&#8220;Would you like to see him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied, still impersonally; and with his
head down, he walked out to where Chapuli was
standing. Then, as if some memory of her voice had
come to him, he dropped the bridle lash and stepped
back quickly into the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t notice my rudeness, Miss Lucy,&#8221;
he began abjectly. &#8220;Of course I am glad to see you;
but I am a little confused, and&ndash;&ndash;well, you understand.&#8221;
He smiled wanly as he spoke, and held out
his hand. &#8220;Is it all right?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Good-bye,
then.&#8221; And as he stepped quietly out the light came
back into Lucy&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to hunt up the judge,&#8221; he said, as he
swung up on his horse; and, despite the protests of
Jeff and Kitty Bonnair, who were still deep in an
animated conversation, he rode off down the river.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></div>
<p>It was not exactly like a draught of Nepenthe to
go out and face the righteous indignation of Judge
Ware, but Hardy&#8217;s brain was in such a whirl that
he welcomed the chance to escape. Never for a
moment had he contemplated the idea of Kitty&#8217;s coming
to him, or of his seeing her again until his heart
was whole. He had felt safe and secure forever
within the walled valley of Hidden Water&ndash;&ndash;but now
from a cloudless sky the lightning had fallen and
blinded him. Before he could raise a hand or even
turn and flee she had come upon him and exacted
his forgiveness. Nay, more&ndash;&ndash;she had won back his
love and enslaved him as before. Could it mean&ndash;&ndash;what
else could it mean? Nothing but that she loved
him; or if not love, then she cared for him above the
others. And Kitty was proud, too! Those who
became her slaves must respect her whims; she would
acknowledge no fault and brook no opposition; whatever
she did was right. Yes, it had always been the
same with her: the Queen could do no wrong&ndash;&ndash;yet
now she had put aside her regal prerogatives and come
to him!</p>
<p>He hugged the thought to his bosom like a man
infatuated, and then a chill misgiving came upon him.
Perhaps after all it was but another of those childish
whims which made her seem so lovable&ndash;&ndash;always
eager, always active, always striving for the forbidden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
and unusual, yet so dear with her laughing
eyes and dancing feet that all the world gave way
before her. He bowed his head in thought, following
the judge&#8217;s tracks mechanically as he cantered
down the trail, and when he came to the hill above the
whirlpool and looked down at the empty landscape
he was still wrestling with his pride. Never in the
two years of his exile had he so much as mentioned
her name to any one; it was a thing too sacred for
confidences, this love which had changed the deep
current of his life, a secret for his own soul and God&ndash;&ndash;and
yet, Lucy Ware might help him!</p>
<p>And where in all the world would he find a more
faithful friend than Lucy Ware? A secret shared
with her would be as safe as if still locked in his own
breast&ndash;&ndash;and Lucy could understand. Perhaps she
understood already; perhaps&ndash;&ndash;his heart stopped, and
pounded against his side&ndash;&ndash;perhaps Kitty had told
Lucy her story already and asked her to intercede!
He dwelt upon the thought again as he gazed dumbly
about for his employer; and then suddenly the outer
world&ndash;&ndash;the plain, rough, rocks-and-cactus world
that he had lived in before they came&ndash;&ndash;flashed up
before him in all its uncompromising clearness; the
judge was nowhere in sight!</p>
<p>A sudden memory of Creede&#8217;s saying that he could
lose his boss any time within half a mile of camp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
startled Hardy out of his dreams and he rode swiftly
forward upon the trail. At the foot of the hill
the tracks of Judge Ware&#8217;s broad shoes with their
nice new hob-nails stood out like a bas-relief,
pointing up the river. Not to take any chances,
Hardy followed them slavishly through the fine
sand until they turned abruptly up onto a ridge
which broke off at the edge of the river bottom.
Along the summit of this they showed again,
plainly, heading north; then as the ravine swung to
the west they scrambled across it and began to zigzag,
working off to the east where Black Butte loomed up
above the maze of brushy ridges like a guiding sentinel.
At first Hardy only smiled at the circuitous
and aimless trail which he was following, expecting
to encounter the judge at every turn; but as the
tracks led steadily on he suddenly put spurs to his
horse and plunged recklessly up and down the sides
of the brushy hogbacks in a desperate pursuit, for the
sun was sinking low. The trail grew fresher and
fresher now; dark spots where drops of sweat had
fallen showed in the dry sand of the washes; and at
last, half an hour before sundown, Hardy caught
sight of his wandering employer, zealously ascending
a particularly rocky butte.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello there, Judge!&#8221; he called, and then, as Judge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
Ware whirled about, he inquired, with well-feigned
surprise: &#8220;Where&#8217;d you drop down from?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was to let the old gentleman down easy&ndash;&ndash;lost
people having a way of waxing indignant at their
rescuers&ndash;&ndash;and the judge was not slow to take advantage
of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, howdy do, Rufus!&#8221; he exclaimed, sinking
down upon a rock. &#8220;I was just taking a little short
cut to camp. My, my, but this is a rough country.
Out looking for cattle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&ndash;&ndash;yes,&#8221; responded Hardy. &#8220;I was taking
a little ride. But say, it&#8217;s about my supper time.
You better give up that short-cut idea and come along
home with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We-ell,&#8221; said the judge, reluctantly descending
the butte, &#8220;I guess I will. How far is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About two miles, by trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two miles!&#8221; exclaimed Judge Ware, aghast.
&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s just over that little hill, there. Why don&#8217;t
you take a short cut?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The trail is the shortest cut I know,&#8221; replied
Hardy, concealing a smile. &#8220;That&#8217;s the way the
cattle go, and they seem to know their business.
How does the country look to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the old judge was not to be led aside by persiflage&ndash;&ndash;he
was interested in the matter of trails.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Cattle trails!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Do you mean to
say that you do all your travelling on these crooked
cow paths? Why, it is a matter of scientific observation
that even on the open prairie a cow path loses
nearly a quarter of its headway by constant winding
in and out, merely to avoid frail bushes and infinitesimal
stones. Now if you and Jeff would spend a little
of your leisure in cutting trails, as they do in forestry,
you would more than save yourselves the time and
labor involved, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said Hardy coldly. There was a subtle
tone of fault-finding in his employer&#8217;s voice which
already augured ill for their debate on the sheep question,
and his nerves responded instinctively to the
jab. Fate had not been so kind to him that day, that
he was prepared to take very much from any man,
and so he remained quiet and let the judge go the
whole length.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, if you would stay about the ranch a
little closer instead of going off on these armed forays
against sheep&ndash;&ndash;now just for example, how much
would it cost to clear a passable trail over that ridge
to the ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed at the hill which in his misguided enthusiasm
he had been mounting, and Hardy&#8217;s eyes glittered
wickedly as he launched his barbed jest.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></div>
<p>&#8220;About a billion dollars, I guess,&#8221; he answered,
after mature consideration.</p>
<p>&#8220;A billion dollars!&#8221; repeated the judge. &#8220;A billion
dollars! Now here, Rufus,&#8221; he cried, choking with
exasperation, &#8220;I am in earnest about this matter! I
don&#8217;t altogether approve of the way you and Jeff have
been conducting my affairs down here, anyway, and
I intend to take a hand myself, if you don&#8217;t mind. I
may not know as much as you about the minor details
of the cattle business, but I have been looking into
forestry quite extensively, and I fail to see anything
unreasonable in my suggestion of a trail. How far
is it, now, over that hill to the ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About twenty-five thousand miles,&#8221; replied Hardy
blandly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-five thousand! Why&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At least, so I am informed,&#8221; explained Hardy.
&#8220;Geographers agree, I believe, that that is the approximate
distance around the world. The ranch is over
here, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed with one small, sinewy hand in a direction
diametrically opposite to the one his boss had
indicated, and struck out down a cow trail. It was
a harsh blow to the old judge, and rankled in his
bosom for some time; but after making sure that his
superintendent was correct he followed meekly behind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
him into camp. On the way, as an afterthought,
he decided not to put down his foot in the matter of
the sheep until he was quite sure of the material facts.</p>
<p>They found Creede in the last throes of agony as
he blundered through the motions of cooking supper.
Half an hour of house-cleaning had done more to
disarrange his kitchen than the services of two charming
assistants could possibly repair. His Dutch
oven was dropped into the wood box; his bread pan
had been used to soak dirty dishes in; the water bucket
was empty, and they had thrown his grease swab into
the fire. As for the dish-rag, after long and faithful
service it had been ruthlessly destroyed, and he had
to make another one out of a flour sack. Add to this
a hunger which had endured since early morning
and a series of rapid-fire questions, and you have the
true recipe for bad bread, at least.</p>
<p>Kitty Bonnair had taken a course in sanitation and
domestic science in her college days, since which time
the world had been full of microbes and every unpleasant
bacillus, of which she discoursed at some length.
But Jefferson Creede held steadily to his fixed ideas,
and in the end he turned out some baking-powder
biscuits that would have won honors in a cooking
school. There was nothing else to cook, his kettle
of beans having been unceremoniously dumped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
because the pot was black; but Kitty had the table
spotlessly clean, there was an assortment of potted
meats and picnic knicknacks in the middle of it, and
Lucy had faithfully scoured the dishes; so supper was
served with frills.</p>
<p>If the ladies had taken hold a little strong in the
first spasms of house-cleaning, Jeff and Rufus were
far too polite to mention it; and while the dishes were
being washed they quietly gathered up their belongings,
and moved them into the storeroom. Their
beds being already spread beneath the <i>ramada</i>, it was
not difficult to persuade the girls to accept Hardy&#8217;s
room, which for a man&#8217;s, was clean, and the judge
fell heir to Jeff&#8217;s well-littered den. All being quickly
arranged and the beds made, Creede threw an armful
of ironwood upon the fire and they sat down to watch
it burn.</p>
<p>Three hours before, Hidden Water had been the
hangout of two sheep-harrying barbarians, bushy-headed
and short of speech; now it was as bright and
cheerful as any home and the barbarians were changed
to lovers. Yet, as they basked in the warmth of the
fireside there was one absent from his accustomed
place&ndash;&ndash;a creature so fierce and shy that his wild spirit
could never become reconciled to the change. At the
first sound of women&#8217;s voices little Tommy had dashed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
through his cat-hole and fled to the bowlder pile at
the foot of the cliff, from whose dank recesses he
peered forth with blank and staring eyes.</p>
<p>But now, as the strange voices grew quiet and night
settled down over the valley, he crept forth and
skulked back to the house, sniffing about the barred
windows, peeking in through his hole in the door;
and at last, drawing well away into the darkness, he
raised his voice in an appealing cry for Jeff.</p>
<p>As the first awful, raucous outburst broke the outer
silence Kitty Bonnair jumped, and Lucy and her
father turned pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; cried Kitty, in a hushed voice, &#8220;a
mountain lion?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; answered Creede enigmatically. &#8220;He
will be though, if he grows. Aw, say, that&#8217;s just
my cat. Here, pussy, pussy, pussy! D&#8217;ye hear
that, now? Sure, he knows me! Wait a minute and
I&#8217;ll try an&#8217; ketch &#8217;im.&#8221;</p>
<p>He returned a few minutes later, with Tommy
held firmly against his breast, blacker, wilder, and
scrawnier than ever, but purring and working his
claws.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s this for a mountain lion?&#8221; said Creede,
stopping just inside the door and soothing down his
pet. &#8220;D&#8217;ye see that hook?&#8221; he inquired, holding up
the end of Tommy&#8217;s crooked tail and laughing at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
Kitty&#8217;s dismay. &#8220;He uses that to climb cliffs with.
That&#8217;s right&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s a new kind of cat. Sure, they
used to be lots of &#8217;em around here, but the coyotes
got all the rest. Tom is the only one left. Want to
pet him? Well&ndash;&ndash;whoa, pussy,&ndash;&ndash;come up careful,
then; he&#8217;s never&ndash;&ndash;ouch!&#8221;</p>
<p>At the first whisk of skirts, Tommy&#8217;s yellow eyes
turned green and he sank every available hook and
claw into his master&#8217;s arm; but when Kitty reached
out a hand he exploded in a storm of spits and hisses
and dashed out through the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, look at that, now,&#8221; said Creede, grinning
and rubbing his arm. &#8220;D&#8217;ye know what&#8217;s the
matter with him? You&#8217;re the first woman he ever
saw in his life. W&#8217;y, sure! They ain&#8217;t no women
around here. I got him off a cowman over on the
Verde. He had a whole litter of &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;used to pinch
Tom&#8217;s tail to make him fight&ndash;&ndash;so when I come away
I jest quietly slipped Mr. Tommy into my shaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the poor little thing,&#8221; said Kitty; and then she
added, puckering up her lips, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t like cats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I do!&#8221; exclaimed Lucy Ware quickly, as
Creede&#8217;s face changed, and for a moment the big
cowboy stood looking at them gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; he said, smiling approvingly at
Lucy; and then, turning to Kitty Bonnair, he said:
&#8220;You want to learn, then.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></div>
<p>But Kitty was not amenable to the suggestion.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she cried, stamping her foot. &#8220;I don&#8217;t!
They&#8217;re such stealthy, treacherous creatures&ndash;&ndash;and
they never have any affection for people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ump-um!&#8221; denied Creede, shaking his head
slowly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know cats&ndash;&ndash;jest think you do,
maybe. W&#8217;y, Tommy was the only friend I had here
for two years. D&#8217;ye think he could fool me all that
time? Rufe here will tell you how he follows after
me for miles&ndash;&ndash;and cryin&#8217;, too&ndash;&ndash;when the coyotes
might git &#8217;im anytime. And he sleeps with me every
night,&#8221; he added, lowering his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can have him,&#8221; said Kitty lightly. &#8220;Do
they have any real mountain lions here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; inquired Creede, still big-eyed with his
emotions. &#8220;Oh, yes; Bill Johnson over in Hell&#8217;s
Hip Pocket makes a business of huntin&#8217; &#8217;em.
Twenty dollars bounty, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, oh!&#8221; cried Kitty. &#8220;Will he take me with
him? Tell me all about it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jefferson Creede moved over toward the door with
a far-away look in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all,&#8221; he said indifferently. &#8220;He runs &#8217;em
with hounds. Well, I&#8217;ll have to bid you good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ducked his head, and stepped majestically out
the door; and Hardy, who was listening, could hear
him softly calling to his cat.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Rufus!&#8221; cried Kitty appealingly, as he rose
to follow, &#8220;<i>do</i> stop and tell me about Bill Johnson,
and, yes&ndash;&ndash;Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Kitty!&#8221; exclaimed Lucy Ware innocently,
and while they were discussing the morals of geographical
swearing Hardy made his bow, and passed
out into the night.</p>
<p>The bitter-sweet of love was upon him again, making
the stars more beautiful, the night more mysterious
and dreamy; but as he crept into his blankets he
sighed. In the adjoining cot he could hear Jeff
stripping slivers from a length of jerked beef, and
Tommy mewing for his share.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want some jerky, Rufe?&#8221; asked Creede, and
then, commenting upon their late supper, he remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;A picnic dinner is all right for canary birds, but
it takes good hard grub to feed a man. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to
start the <i>rod&eacute;r</i> camp in the mornin&#8217; and cook me up
some beans.&#8221; He lay for a while in silence, industriously
feeding himself on the dry meat, and gazing at
the sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Rufe,&#8221; he said, at last, &#8220;ain&#8217;t you been
holdin&#8217; out on me a little?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um-huh,&#8221; assented Hardy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Been gettin&#8217; letters from Miss Lucy all the time,
eh?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; remarked Creede, &#8220;you&#8217;re a hell of
a feller! But I reckon I learned somethin&#8217;,&#8221; he
added philosophically, &#8220;and when I want somebody
to tell my troubles to, I&#8217;ll know where to go. Say,
she&#8217;s all right, ain&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;re you talkin&#8217; about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;re you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you know, all right, all right&ndash;&ndash;but, say!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity she don&#8217;t like cats.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE GARDEN IN THE DESERT</h3>
</div>
<p>The sun was well up over the ca&ntilde;on rim when the
tired visitors awoke from their dreams. Kitty
Bonnair was the first to open her eyes and peep forth
upon the fairy world which promised so much of
mystery and delight. The iron bars of their window,
deep set in the adobe walls, suggested the dungeon
of some strong prison where Spanish maidens languished
for sight of their lovers; a rifle in the corner,
overlooked in the hurried moving, spoke eloquently
of the armed brutality of the times; the hewn logs
which supported the lintels completed the picture of
primitive life; and a soft breeze, breathing in through
the unglazed sills, whispered of dark ca&ntilde;ons and the
wild, free out-of-doors.</p>
<p>As she lay there drinking it all in a murmur of
voices came to her ears; and, peering out, she saw
Creede and Rufus Hardy squatting by a fire out by
the giant mesquite tree which stood near the bank of
the creek. Creede was stirring the contents of a frying-pan
with a huge iron spoon, and Rufus was cooking
strips of meat on a stick which he turned above a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
bed of coals. There was no sign of hurry or anxiety
about their preparations; they seemed to be conversing
amiably of other things. Presently Hardy
picked up a hooked stick, lifted the cover from the
Dutch oven, and dumped a pile of white biscuits upon
a greasy cloth. Then, still deep in their talk, they
filled their plates from the fry-pan, helped themselves
to meat, wrapped the rest of the bread in the cloth,
and sat comfortably back on their heels, eating with
their fingers and knives.</p>
<p>It was all very simple and natural, but somehow
she had never thought of men in that light before.
They were so free, so untrammelled and self-sufficient;
yes, and so barbarous, too. Rufus Hardy, the poet,
she had known&ndash;&ndash;quiet, soft-spoken, gentle, with
dreamy eyes and a doglike eagerness to please&ndash;&ndash;but,
lo! here was another Rufus, still gentle, but with a
stern look in his eyes which left her almost afraid&ndash;&ndash;and
those two lost years lay between. How he must have
changed in all that time! The early morning was
Kitty&#8217;s time for meditation and good resolutions, and
she resolved then and there to be nice to Rufus, for he
was a man and could not understand.</p>
<p>As the sound of voices came from the house Jefferson
Creede rose up from his place and stalked across
the open, rolling and swaying in his high-heeled
boots like a huge, woolly bear.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, Judge,&#8221; he said, after throwing a mountain
of wood on the fire as a preliminary to cooking breakfast
for his guests, &#8220;I suppose now you&#8217;re here you&#8217;d
like to ride around a little and take stock of what
you&#8217;ve got. The boys will begin comin&#8217; in for the
<i>rod&eacute;r</i> to-day, and after to-morrow I&#8217;ll be pretty
busy; but if you say so I&#8217;ll jest ketch up a gentle
horse, and show you the upper range before the work
begins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, won&#8217;t you take me, too?&#8221; cried Kitty, skipping
in eagerly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got the nicest saddle&ndash;&ndash;and I
bet I can ride any horse you&#8217;ve got.&#8221;</p>
<p>She assumed a cowboy-like strut as she made this
assertion, shaking her head in a bronco gesture which
dashed the dark hair from her eyes and made her look
like an unbroken thoroughbred. Never in all his life,
even in the magazine pictures of stage beauties which
form a conspicuous mural decoration in those parts,
had Creede seen a woman half so charming, but even
in his love blindness he was modest.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to leave that to the judge,&#8221; he said
deferentially, &#8220;but they&#8217;s horses for everybody.&#8221;
He glanced inquiringly at Lucy, who was busily unpacking
her sketching kit; but she only smiled, and
shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;The home is going to be my sphere for some
time,&#8221; she remarked, glancing about at the half-cleaned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
room, &#8220;and then,&#8221; she added, with decision,
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to make some of the loveliest water colors
in the world. I think that big giant cactus standing
on that red-and-gray cliff over there is simply wonderful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um, pretty good,&#8221; observed Creede judicially.
&#8220;But you jest ought to see &#8217;em in the gorge where
Hidden Water comes out! Are ye goin&#8217; along,
Rufe?&#8221; he inquired, bending his eyes upon Hardy
with a knowing twinkle. &#8220;No? Well, <i>you</i> can show
her where it is! Didn&#8217;t you never hear why they call
this Hidden Water?&#8221; he asked, gazing benignly upon
the young ladies. &#8220;Well, listen.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;s a big spring of water right up here, not
half a mile. It&#8217;s an old landmark&ndash;&ndash;the Mexicans
call it Agua Escondida&ndash;&ndash;but I bet neither one of you
can find it and I&#8217;ll take you right by the gulch where
it comes out. They can&#8217;t nobody find it, unless
they&#8217;re wise enough to follow cow tracks&ndash;&ndash;and of
course, we don&#8217;t expect that of strangers. But if you
ever git lost and you&#8217;re within ten miles of home jest
take the first cow trail you see and follow it downhill
and you&#8217;ll go into one end or the other of Hidden
Water ca&ntilde;on. Sure, it&#8217;s what you might call the
Hello-Central of the whole Four Peaks country, with
cow paths instead of wires. The only thing lackin&#8217;
is the girls, to talk back, and call you down for your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
ungentlemanly language, and&ndash;&ndash;well, this country is
comin&#8217; up every day!&#8221;</p>
<p>He grinned broadly, wiping his floury hands on
his overalls in defiance of Miss Kitty&#8217;s most rudimentary
principles; and yet even she, for all her
hygiene, was compelled to laugh. There was something
about Creede that invited confidence and feminine
badgering, he was so like a big, good-natured
boy. The entire meal was enlivened by her efforts,
in the person of a hello girl, to expurgate his language,
and she ended by trying to get him to swear&ndash;&ndash;politely.</p>
<p>But in this the noble cowboy was inexorable. &#8220;No,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said, with an excess of moral conviction.
&#8220;I never swear except for cause&ndash;&ndash;and then I always
regret it. But if you want to git some of the real
thing to put in your phonygraft jest come down to
the pasture to-morrow when the boys are breakin&#8217;
horses. Your hair&#8217;s kind of wavy, I notice, but it
will put crimps in it to hear Bill Lightfoot or some of
them Sunflower stiffs when they git bucked onto
a rock pile. And say, if you call yourself a rider I
can give you a snake for to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, Mr. Creede,&#8221; answered Miss Kitty,
bowing low as she left the table. &#8220;Its tail, if it
chanced to be a rattler, would be most acceptable, I
am sure, and I might make a belt out of its skin. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
for riding purposes I prefer a real, gentle little horse.
Now hurry up, and I&#8217;ll be dressed in half an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Creede rode up to the house,
leading a sober gray for the judge, but for Kitty
Bonnair he had the prettiest little calico-horse in the
bunch, a pony painted up with red and yellow and
white until he looked like a three-color chromo.
Even his eye was variegated, being of a mild, pet-rabbit
blue, with a white circle around the orbit; and
his name, of course, was Pinto. To be sure, his face
was a little dished in and he showed other signs of his
scrub Indian blood, but after Creede had cinched on
the new stamped-leather saddle and adjusted the
ornate hackamore and martingale, Pinto was the
sportiest-looking horse outside of a Wild West show.</p>
<p>There was a long wait then, while Diana completed
her preparations for the hunt; but when Kitty Bonnair,
fully apparelled, finally stepped through the
door Creede reeled in the saddle, and even Rufus
Hardy gasped. There was nothing immodest about
her garb&ndash;&ndash;in fact, it was very correct and proper&ndash;&ndash;but
not since the Winship girls rode forth in overalls
had Hidden Water seen its like. Looking very trim
and boyish in her khaki riding breeches, Kitty strode
forth unabashed, rejoicing in her freedom. A little
scream of delight escaped her as she caught sight of
the calico-pony; she patted his nose a moment, inquired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
his name, and then, scorning all assistance,
swung lightly up into the saddle. No prettier
picture had ever been offered to the eye; so young,
so supple and strong, with such a wealth of dark,
wavy hair, and, withal, so modest and honestly happy.
But, somehow, Jefferson Creede took the lead and
rode with his eyes cast down, lest they should be
dazzled by the vision. Besides, Jeff had been raised
old-fashioned, and Golden Gate Park is a long, long
ways, chronologically, from Hidden Water.</p>
<p>As the procession passed away up the ca&ntilde;on, with
Creede in sober converse with the judge and Kitty
scampering about like an Indian on her pinto horse,
Hardy and Lucy Ware glanced at each other, and
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever see any one like her?&#8221; exclaimed
Lucy, and Hardy admitted with a sigh that he never
had.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am afraid,&#8221; observed Miss Lucy frankly,
&#8220;you were not altogether pleased to see her&ndash;&ndash;at first.
But really, Rufus, what can any one hope to do with
Kitty? When she has set her heart on anything she
<i>will have it</i>, and from the very moment she read your
first letter she was determined to come down here.
Of course father thinks he came down to look into
this matter of the sheep, and <i>I</i> think that I came
down to look after him, but in reality I have no doubt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
we are both here because Kitty Bonnair so wills
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; replied Hardy, with a doubtful
smile. &#8220;But since you are in her counsels perhaps
you can tell what her intentions are toward me. I
used to be one of her gentlemen-in-waiting, you
know, and this visit looks rather ominous for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, just exactly what are you talking about,
Rufus?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you know, all right,&#8221; replied Hardy.
&#8220;Have I got to ride a bucking bronco, or kill a sheep-herder
or two&ndash;&ndash;or is it just another case of &#8216;move
on&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and smiled bitterly to himself, but
Lucy was not in a mood to humor him in his misanthropy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must confess,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that you may be called
upon to do a few chivalrous feats of horsemanship,
but as for the sheep-herder part of it, I hope you will
try to please me by leaving them alone. It worries
me, Rufus,&#8221; she continued soberly, &#8220;to see you becoming
so strong-willed and silent. There was a whole
year, when none of us heard a word from you&ndash;&ndash;and
then it was quite by accident. And father thinks you
stopped writing to him with the deliberate intention
of driving the sheep away by violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad he understands so well,&#8221; replied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
Hardy naively. &#8220;Of course I wouldn&#8217;t embarrass
him by asking for orders, but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Rufus!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Lucy impatiently,
&#8220;do try to be natural again and take your mind off
those sheep. Do you know what I am thinking of
doing?&#8221; she demanded seriously. &#8220;I am thinking of
asking father to give me this ranch&ndash;&ndash;he said he would
if I wanted it&ndash;&ndash;and then I&#8217;ll discharge you! You
shall not be such a brutal, ugly man! But come, now,
I want you to help clear the table, and then we will
go up to Hidden Water and read your poems. But
tell me, have you had any trouble with the sheepmen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no!&#8221; answered Hardy innocently. &#8220;What
made you ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you wrote father you expected trouble&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and
you had that big, long pistol when you
came in yesterday. Now you can&#8217;t deny that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ve had some Western ideas implanted
in your bosom by Kitty, Miss Lucy,&#8221; protested
Hardy. &#8220;We never shoot each other down
here. I carry that pistol for the moral effect&ndash;&ndash;and
it&#8217;s necessary, too, to protect these sheepmen against
their own baser natures. You see they&#8217;re all armed,
and if I should ride into their camp without a gun
and ask them to move they might be tempted to do
something overt. But as it is now, when Jeff and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
begin to talk reason with them they understand. No,
<i>we&#8217;re</i> all right; it&#8217;s the sheep-herders that have all
the trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rufus Hardy,&#8221; cried Miss Lucy indignantly, &#8220;if
you mention those sheep again until you are asked
about them, I&#8217;ll have you attended to. Do you
realize how far I have come to see your poems and
hear you talk the way you used to talk? And then to
hear you go on in this way! I thought at first that
Mr. Creede was a nice man, but I am beginning to
change my opinion of him. But you have just got
to be nice to me and Kitty while we are here. I had
so many things to tell you about your father, and
Tupper Browne, and The Circle, but you just sit
around so kind of close-mouthed and silent and never
ask a question! Wouldn&#8217;t you like to know how
your father is?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; responded Hardy meekly. &#8220;Have
you seen him lately?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw him just before we came away. He is
dreadfully lonely, I know, but he wouldn&#8217;t send any
message. He never says <i>anything</i> when I tell him
what you are doing, just sits and twists his mustache
and listens; but I could tell by the way he said good-bye
that he was glad I was coming. I am sorry you
can&#8217;t agree&ndash;&ndash;isn&#8217;t there something you could do to
make him happier?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>Hardy looked up from his dish-washing with a slow
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which do you think is more important?&#8221; he
asked, &#8220;for a man to please his father or his best
friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy suspected a trap and she made no reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever quote any of my poetry to father?&#8221;
inquired Hardy casually. &#8220;No? Then please don&#8217;t.
But I&#8217;ll bet if you told him I was catching wild
horses, or talking reason to these Mexican herders,
you&#8217;d have the old man coming. He&#8217;s a fighter, my
father, and if you want to make him happy when you
go back, tell him his son has just about given up
literature and is the champion bronco-twister of the
Four Peaks range.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Rufus&ndash;&ndash;would that be the truth?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardy laughed. &#8220;Well, pretty near it&ndash;&ndash;but I&#8217;m
trying to please my best friend now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Lucy, blushing. &#8220;Will&ndash;&ndash;will that make
much difference?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the difference in the world,&#8221; declared Hardy
warmly. &#8220;You want me to become a poet&ndash;&ndash;he wants
me to become a fighter. Well now, since I haven&#8217;t
been able to please him, I&#8217;m going to try to please
you for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Rufus,&#8221; cried Lucy, &#8220;am I really&ndash;&ndash;your best
friend?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why sure! Didn&#8217;t you know that?&#8221; He spoke
the words with a bluff good-fellowship which pleased
her, in a way, but at the same time left her silent.
And he, too, realized that there was a false note, a rift
such as often creeps in between friends and if not
perceived and checked widens into a breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; he said, quietly making his amends,
&#8220;when I was a boy my father always told me I talked
too much; and after mother died I&ndash;&ndash;well, I didn&#8217;t
talk so much. I was intended for a soldier, you
know, and good officers have to keep their own
counsel. But&ndash;&ndash;well, I guess the habit struck in&ndash;&ndash;so
if I don&#8217;t always thank you, or tell you things, you
will understand, won&#8217;t you? I wasn&#8217;t raised to
please folks, you know, but just to fight Indians, and
all that. How would you like to be a soldier&#8217;s wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very well, I am afraid,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All the
fear and anxiety, and&ndash;&ndash;well, I&#8217;m afraid I couldn&#8217;t
love my husband if he killed anybody.&#8221; She paused
and glanced up at him, but he was deep in thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother was a soldier&#8217;s wife,&#8221; he said, at last;
and Lucy, seeing where his thoughts had strayed, respected
his silence. It was something she had learned
long before, for while Rufus would sometimes mention
his mother he would never talk about her, even
to Lucy Ware. So they finished their housework,
deep in their own thoughts. But when at last they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
stepped out into the sunshine Lucy touched him on
the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like to bring your poems with
you?&#8221; she suggested. &#8220;We can read them when we
have found the spring. Is it very beautiful up
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Hardy, &#8220;I often go there to write,
when nobody is around. You know Jeff and all these
cowboys around here don&#8217;t know that I write verse.
They just think I&#8217;m a little fellow from somewhere
up in California that can ride horses pretty good.
But if I had handed it out to them that I was a poet,
or even a college man, they would have gone to tucking
snakes into my blankets and dropping <i>chili bravos</i>
into my beans until they got a rise out of me, sure.
I learned that much before I ever came up here.
But I&#8217;ve got a little place I call my garden&ndash;&ndash;up in
the ca&ntilde;on, above Hidden Water&ndash;&ndash;and sometimes I
sneak off up there, and write. Would you like to see
a poem I wrote up there? All right, you can have
the rest some other time.&#8221; He stepped into the storeroom,
extracted a little bundle from his war bag, and
then they passed on up the valley together.</p>
<p>The ca&ntilde;on of the Alamo is like most Arizona
stream beds, a strait-jacket of rocky walls, opening
out at intervals into pocket-like valleys, such as the
broad and fertile flat which lay below Hidden Water.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
On either side of the stream the banks rise in benches,
each a little higher and broader and more heavily
covered: the first pure sand, laid on by the last
freshet; the next grown over with grass and weeds;
the next bushed up with baby willows and arrow
weed; and then, the high bench, studded with mesquite
and <i>palo verdes</i>; and at the base of the solid rim perhaps
a higher level, strewn with the rocks which time
and the elements have hurled down from the cliff, and
crested with ancient trees. Upon such a high bench
stood the Dos S ranch house, with trails leading off up
and down the flat or plunging down the bank, the
striated cliff behind it and the water-torn valley
below.</p>
<p>Up the ca&ntilde;on a deep-worn path led along the base
of the bluff; and as the two best friends followed
along its windings Hardy pointed out the mysteries
of the land: strange trees and shrubs, bristling with
thorns; cactus in its myriad forms; the birds which
flashed past them or sang in the wild gladness of
springtime; lizards, slipping about in the sands or
pouring from cracks in the rocks&ndash;&ndash;all the curious
things which his eyes had seen and his mind taken
note of in the long days of solitary riding, and which
his poet&#8217;s soul now interpreted into a higher meaning
for the woman who could understand. So intent
were they upon the wonders of that great display that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
Lucy hardly noticed where they were, until the trail
swung abruptly in toward the cliff and they seemed
to be entering a cleft in the solid rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do we go now?&#8221; she asked, and Hardy
laughed at her confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the gate to Hidden Water,&#8221; he said, lowering
his voice to its old-time poetic cadence. &#8220;And
strait is the way thereof,&#8221; he added, as he led her
through the narrow pass, &#8220;but within are tall trees and
running water, and the eagle nests undisturbed
among the crags.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>are</i> you quoting?&#8221; exclaimed Miss Lucy,
and for an answer Rufus beckoned her in and pointed
with his hand. Before them stood the tall trees with
running water at their feet, and a great nest of sticks
among the crags.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hidden Water!&#8221; he said, and smiled again mysteriously.</p>
<p>Then he led the way along the side of the stream,
which slipped softly over the water-worn bowlders,
dimpling in pool after pool, until at the very gate of
the valley it sank into the sand and was lost. Higher
and higher mounted the path; and then, at the foot of
a smooth ledge which rose like a bulwark across the
gorge, it ended suddenly by the side of a cattle-tracked
pool.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the wall to my garden,&#8221; said Hardy, pointing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
to the huge granite dyke, &#8220;beyond which only the
elect may pass.&#8221; He paused, and glanced over at her
quizzically. &#8220;The path was not made for ladies, I am
afraid,&#8221; he added, pointing to a series of foot holes
which ran up the face of the ledge. &#8220;Do you think
you can climb it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy Ware studied his face for a moment; then,
turning to the Indian stairway, she measured it with
a practised eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go up first,&#8221; she suggested, and when he had
scaled the slippery height and turned he found her
close behind, following carefully in his steps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you <i>are</i> a climber!&#8221; he cried admiringly.
&#8220;Here, give me your hand.&#8221; And when he had
helped her up he still held it&ndash;&ndash;or perhaps she clung
to his.</p>
<p>Before them lay a little glade, shut in by painted
rocks, upon whose black sides were engraved many
curious pictures, the mystic symbols of the Indians;
and as they stood gazing at it an eagle with pointed
wings wheeled slowly above them, gazing with clear
eyes down into the sunlit vale. From her round nest
in the crotch of a sycamore a great horned owl
plunged out at their approach and glided noiselessly
away; and in the stillness the zooning of bees
among the rocks came to their ears like distant music.
Beneath their feet the grass grew long and matted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
shot here and there with the blue and gold of
flowers, like the rich meadows of the East; and
clustering along the hillsides, great bunches of
grama grass waved their plumes proudly, the last
remnant of all that world of feed which had clothed
the land like a garment before the days of the sheep.
For here, at least, there came no nibbling wethers, nor
starving cattle; and the mountain sheep which had
browsed there in the old days were now hiding on
the topmost crags of the Superstitions to escape the
rifles of the destroyers. All the world without was
laid waste and trampled by hurrying feet, but the
garden of Hidden Water was still kept inviolate, a
secret shrine consecrated to Nature and Nature&#8217;s God.</p>
<p>As she stood in the presence of all its beauty a mist
came into Lucy&#8217;s eyes and she turned away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Rufus,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you live up here
always instead of wasting your life in that awful
struggle with the sheep? You could&ndash;&ndash;why, you could
do anything up here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Hardy, &#8220;it is a beautiful spot&ndash;&ndash;I
often come up here when I am weary with it all&ndash;&ndash;but
a man must do a man&#8217;s work, you know; and my
work is with the sheep. When I first came to Hidden
Water I knew nothing of the sheep. I thought the
little lambs were pretty; the ewes were mothers, the
herders human beings. I tried to be friends with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
them, to keep the peace and abide by the law; but now
that I&#8217;ve come to know them I agree with Jeff, who
has been fighting them for twenty years. There is
something about the smell of sheep which robs men
of their humanity; they become greedy and avaricious;
the more they make the more they want. Of
all the sheepmen that I know there isn&#8217;t one who
would go around me out of friendship or pity&ndash;&ndash;and
I have done favors for them all. But they&#8217;re no
friends of mine now,&#8221; he added ominously. &#8220;I have
to respect my friends, and I can&#8217;t respect a man who
is all hog. There&#8217;s no pretence on either side now,
though&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;re trying to sheep us out and we are
trying to fight them off, and if it ever comes to a
show-down&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, and his eyes glowed with a strange
light.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I haven&#8217;t very much to live for, Miss
Lucy,&#8221; he said earnestly, &#8220;but if I had all that God
could give me I&#8217;d stand by Jeff against the sheep.
It&#8217;s all right to be a poet or an artist, a lover of truth
and beauty, and all that, but if a man won&#8217;t stand
up for his friends when they&#8217;re in trouble he&#8217;s a kind
of closet philosopher that shrinks from all the realities
of life&ndash;&ndash;a poor, puny creature, at the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood up very straight as he poured out this
torrent of words, gazing at her intently, but with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
eyes set, as if he beheld some vision. Yet whether it
was of himself and Jeff, fighting their hopeless battle
against the sheep, or of his life as it might have been if
Kitty had been as gentle with him as this woman by his
side, there was no telling. His old habit of reticence
fell back upon him as suddenly as it had been cast
aside, and he led the way up the little stream in silence.
As he walked, the ardor of his passion cooled, and he
began to point out things with his eloquent hands&ndash;&ndash;the
minnows, wheeling around in the middle of a
glassy pool; a striped bullfrog, squatting within the
spray of a waterfall; huge combs of honey, hanging
from shelving caverns along the cliff where the wild
bees had stored their plunder for years. At last, as
they stood before a drooping elder whose creamy
blossoms swayed beneath the weight of bees, he
halted and motioned to a shady seat against the
ca&ntilde;on wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are gardens in every desert,&#8221; he said, as she
sank down upon the grassy bank, &#8220;but this is ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>They sat for a while, gazing contentedly at the
clusters of elder blossoms which hung above them,
filling the air with a rich fragrance which was spiced
by the tang of sage. A ruby-throated humming-bird
flashed suddenly past them and was gone; a red-shafted
woodpecker, still more gorgeous in his scarlet
plumage, descended in uneven flights from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
<i>sahuaros</i> that clung against the cliff and, fastening
upon a hollow tree, set up a mysterious rapping.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is hunting for grubs,&#8221; explained Hardy.
&#8220;Does that inspire you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; answered Lucy, puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Mexicans call him <i>pajaro corazon</i>&ndash;&ndash;<i>p&aacute;h-hah-ro
cor-ah-s&oacute;ne</i>,&#8221; continued the poet. &#8220;Does that
appeal to your soul?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no. What does it mean&ndash;&ndash;woodpecker?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardy smiled. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a woodpecker with
them is called <i>carpintero</i>&ndash;&ndash;carpenter, you understand&ndash;&ndash;because
he hammers on trees; but my friend up on
the stump yonder is <i>Pajaro Corazon</i>&ndash;&ndash;bird of the
heart. I have a poem dedicated to him.&#8221; Then, as
if to excuse himself from the reading, he hastened on:
&#8220;Of course, no true poet would commit such a breach&ndash;&ndash;he
would write a sonnet to his lady&#8217;s eyebrow, a
poem in memory of a broken dream, or some sad
lament for Love, which has died simultaneously with
his own blasted hopes. But a sense of my own unimportance
has saved me&ndash;&ndash;or the world, at any rate&ndash;&ndash;from
such laments. <i>Pajaro Corazon</i> and <i>Chupa
Rosa</i>, a little humming-bird who lives in that elder
tree, have been my only friends and companions in
the muse, until you came. I wouldn&#8217;t abuse <i>Chupa
Rosa&#8217;s</i> confidence by reading my poem to her. Her
lover has turned out a worthless fellow and left her&ndash;&ndash;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
was him you saw flying past just now, going up
the ca&ntilde;on to sport around with the other hummers&ndash;&ndash;but
here is my poem to <i>Pajaro Corazon</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew forth his bundle of papers and in a shamefaced
way handed one of them to Lucy. It was a
slip of yellow note paper, checked along the margin
with groups of rhyming words and scansion marks,
and in the middle this single verse.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='indent6'>&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Pajaro Corazon!  Bird of the Heart!<br />
Some knight of honor in those bygone days<br />
Of dreams and gold and quests through desert lands,<br />
Seeing thy blood-red heart flash in the rays<br />
Of setting sun&ndash;&ndash;which lured him far from Spain&ndash;&ndash;<br />
Lifted his face and, reading there a sign<br />
From his dear lady, crossed himself and spake<br />
Then first, the name which still is thine.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Lucy folded the paper and gazed across at him
rapturously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Rufus,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you send it to
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it good?&#8221; asked Hardy, forgetting his pose; and
when she nodded solemnly he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is another verse&ndash;&ndash;look on the other side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy turned the paper over quickly and read again:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='indent6'>&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Pajaro Corazon!  Bird of the Heart!<br />
Some Padre, wayworn, stooping towards his grave,<br />
Whom God by devious ways had sent so far,<br />
So far from Spain&ndash;&ndash;still pressing on to save
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span><br />
The souls He loved, now, raising up his eyes<br />
And seeing on thy breast the bleeding heart<br />
Of Jesus, cast his robes aside and spake<br />
Thy name&ndash;&ndash;and set that place apart.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>As she followed the lines Hardy watched her face
with eyes that grew strangely soft and gentle. It
was Lucy Ware of all the world who understood him.
Others laughed, or pitied, or overdid it, or remained
unmoved, but Lucy with her trusting blue eyes and
broad poet&#8217;s brow&ndash;&ndash;a brow which always made him
think of Mrs. Browning who was a poet indeed, she
always read his heart, in her he could safely trust.
And now, when those dear eyes filled up with tears
he could have taken her hand, yes, he could have
kissed her&ndash;&ndash;if he had not been afraid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rufus,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;you are a poet.&#8221; And
then she dried her eyes and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me read some more,&#8221; she pleaded; but Hardy
held the bundle resolutely away.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;it is enough to have pleased
you once. You know poetry is like music; it is an
expression of thoughts which are more than thoughts.
They come up out of the great sea of our inner soul
like the breath of flowers from a hidden garden, like
the sound of breakers from the ocean cliffs; but not
every one can scent their fragrance, and some ears are
too dull to hear music in the rush of waters. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
when one has caught the music of another&#8217;s song then
it is best to stop before&ndash;&ndash;before some discord comes.
Lucy,&#8221; he began, as his soul within him rose up and
clamored for it knew not what, &#8220;Lucy&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, and the woman hung upon his lips to
catch the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; she said, but the thought had suddenly left
him. It was a great longing&ndash;&ndash;that he knew&ndash;&ndash;a great
desire, unsensed because unknown&ndash;&ndash;but deep, deep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&ndash;&ndash;Rufus?&#8221; she breathed, leaning over; but the
light had gone out of his eyes and he gazed at her
strangely.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is nothing,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;nothing. I&ndash;&ndash;I
have forgotten what I was going to say.&#8221; He sighed,
and looked moodily at his feet. &#8220;The thoughts of a
would-be poet,&#8221; he mused, cynically. &#8220;How valuable
they are&ndash;&ndash;how the world must long for them&ndash;&ndash;when
he even forgets them himself! I guess I&#8217;d
better keep still and let you talk a while,&#8221; he ended,
absently. But Lucy Ware sat gazing before her in
silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it time we returned?&#8221; she asked, after a
while. &#8220;You know I have a great deal to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Hardy, easily, &#8220;I&#8217;ll help
you. What do you want to do&ndash;&ndash;clean house?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy could have cried at her hero&#8217;s sudden lapse&ndash;&ndash;from
Parnassus to the scullery, from love to the commonplaces
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
of living; but she had schooled herself to
bear with him, since patience is a woman&#8217;s part. Yet
her honest blue eyes were not adapted to concealment
and, furtively taking note of her distress, Hardy fell
into the role of a penitent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is my garden such a poor place,&#8221; he inquired
gravely, &#8220;that you must leave it the moment we have
come? You have not even seen <i>Chupa Rosa</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, show me <i>Chupa Rosa</i>&ndash;&ndash;and then we will
go.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke the words reluctantly, rising slowly to
her feet; and Hardy knew that in some hidden way
he had hurt her, yet in what regard he could not tell.
A vague uneasiness came over him and he tried awkwardly
to make amends for his fault, but good intentions
never yet crossed a river or healed a breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is her nest,&#8221; he said, &#8220;almost above our seat.
Look, Lucy, it is made out of willow down and
spider webs, bound round and round the twig. Don&#8217;t
you want to see the eggs? Look!&#8221; He bent the limb
until the dainty white treasures, half buried in the
fluffy down, were revealed&ndash;&ndash;but still she did not smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, stop, Rufus!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;what will the mother-bird
think? She might be frightened at us and leave
her nest. Come, let&#8217;s hurry away before she sees us!&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned and walked quickly down the valley,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
never pausing to look back, even when Rufus stopped
to pluck a flower from among the rocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he said, after he had helped her down the
Indian stairway; and when she held up her hand,
passively, he dropped a forget-me-not into it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, carried away for a moment, &#8220;do
they grow down here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, soberly, &#8220;even here. And they&ndash;&ndash;sometimes
you find them where you wouldn&#8217;t expect&ndash;&ndash;in
rough places, you know, and among the stones.
I&ndash;&ndash;I hope you will keep it,&#8221; he said, simply. And
Lucy divined what was in his heart, better perhaps
than he himself; but when at last she was alone she
buried her face in the pillow, and for a long time the
house was very still.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>A SNOW-SCENE</h3>
</div>
<p>There was a big fire out under the mesquite
that night and a band of cowboys, in all the
bravery of spurs, shaps, and pistols, romped around it
in a stage-struck exuberance of spirits. The night
was hardly cold enough to call for fringed leather
<i>chaparejos</i>, and their guns should have been left in
their blankets; nor are long-shanked Texas spurs
quite the proper thing about camp, having a dirty
way of catching and tripping their wearers; but the
<i>rod&eacute;o</i> outfit felt that it was on dress parade and was
trying its best to look the cowboy part. Bill Lightfoot
even had a red silk handkerchief draped about
his neck, with the slack in front, like a German
napkin; and his cartridge belt was slung so low that
it threatened every moment to drop his huge Colt&#8217;s
revolver into the dirt&ndash;&ndash;but who could say a word?</p>
<p>The news of Judge Ware&#8217;s visit had passed
through the Four Peaks country like the rumor of
an Indian uprising and every man rode into Hidden
Water with an eye out for calico, some with a foolish
grin, some downcast and reserved, some swaggering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
in the natural pride of the lady&#8217;s man. But
a becoming modesty had kept Lucy Ware indoors,
and Kitty had limited herself to a furtive survey of
the scene from behind what was left of Sallie Winship&#8217;s
lace curtains. With the subtle wisdom of a
<i>rod&eacute;o</i> boss Jefferson Creede had excused himself
to the ladies at the first sound of jangling horse-bells,
and now he kept resolutely away from the house,
busying himself with the manifold duties of his position.
To the leading questions of Bill Lightfoot and
the &#8220;fly bunch&#8221; which followed his lead he turned a
deaf ear or replied in unsatisfying monosyllables;
and at last, as the fire lit up the trees and flickered
upon their guns and silver-mounted trappings and
no fair maids sallied forth to admire them, the overwrought
emotions of the cowboys sought expression
in song.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;Oh my little girl she lives in the town,&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>chanted Lightfoot, and the fly bunch, catching the
contagion, joined promptly in on the refrain:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><i>&#8220;A toodle link, a toodle link, a too&ndash;&ndash;oo-dle a day!&#8221;</i></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>At this sudden and suggestive outbreak Jeff
Creede surveyed Bill Lightfoot coldly and puffed
on his cigarette. Bill was always trying to make
trouble.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;And every time I see &#8217;er, she asts me f&#8217;r a gown,&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></div>
<p>carolled the leading cowboy; and the bunch, not to
seem faint-hearted, chimed in again:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><i>&#8220;Reladin to reladin, and reladin to relate!&#8221;</i></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Now they were verging toward the sensational
part of the ballad, the place where a real gentleman
would quit, but Lightfoot only tossed his head
defiantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;O-Oh&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he began, and then he stopped with his
mouth open. The <i>rod&eacute;o</i> boss had suddenly risen
to an upright position and fixed him with his eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to see you boys enjoyin&#8217; yourselves,&#8221; he
observed, quietly, &#8220;but please don&#8217;t discuss <i>politics</i>
or <i>religion</i> while them ladies is over at the house.
You better switch off onto &#8216;My Bonnie Lies over the
Ocean,&#8217; Bill.&#8221; And Bill switched.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he demanded aggrieved,
&#8220;ain&#8217;t anybody but you got any rights and privileges
around here? You go sportin&#8217; around and havin&#8217; a
good time all day, but as soon as one of us punchers
opens his mouth you want to jump down his throat.
What do <i>we</i> know about ladies&ndash;&ndash;<i>I</i> ain&#8217;t seen none!&#8221;</p>
<p>The discussion of the moral code which followed
was becoming acrimonious and personal to a degree
when a peal of girlish laughter echoed from the
ranch house and the cowboys beheld Judge Ware
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
and Hardy, accompanied by Miss Lucy and Kitty
Bonnair, coming towards their fire. A less tactful
man might have taken advantage of the hush to utter
a final word of warning to his rebellious subjects, but
Creede knew Kitty Bonnair and the human heart
too well. As the party came into camp he rose
quietly and introduced the judge and the ladies to
every man present, without deviation and without
exception, and then, having offered Miss Ware his
cracker box, he moved over a man or two and sat
down.</p>
<p>In the bulk of his mighty frame, the rugged power
of his countenance, and the unconscious authority of
his words he was easily master of them all; but though
he had the voice of Mars and a head like Olympian
Zeus he must needs abase his proud spirit to the
demands of the occasion, for the jealousy of mortal
man is a proverb. Where the punchers that he hired
for thirty dollars a month were decked out in shaps
and handkerchiefs he sat in his shirt-sleeves and overalls,
with only his high-heeled boots and the enormous
black sombrero which he always wore, to mark him
for their king. And the first merry question which
Miss Kitty asked he allowed to pass unnoticed, until
Bill Lightfoot&ndash;&ndash;to save the credit of the bunch&ndash;&ndash;answered
it himself.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he replied politely. &#8220;That was a
genuwine cowboy song we was singin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;we sing &#8217;em
to keep the cattle awake at night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how interesting!&#8221; exclaimed Kitty, leaning
forward in her eagerness. &#8220;But why do you try to
keep them awake? I should think they would be so
tired, after travelling all day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; responded Bill, twisting his silk
handkerchief nervously, &#8220;but if they go to sleep and
anything wakes &#8217;em up quick they stompede&ndash;&ndash;so we
ride through &#8217;em and sing songs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think of that, Lucy!&#8221; cried Miss Kitty enthusiastically.
&#8220;And it was such a pretty tune, too!
Won&#8217;t you sing it again, Mr. Lightfoot? I&#8217;d just
love to hear it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Here was a facer for Mr. Lightfoot, and Jefferson
Creede, to whom all eyes were turned in the crisis,
smiled maliciously and let him sweat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill ain&#8217;t in very good voice to-night,&#8221; he observed
at last, as the suspense became unbearable, &#8220;and
we&#8217;re kinder bashful about singin&#8217; to company, anyway.
But if you want to hear somethin&#8217; good, you
want to git Bill goin&#8217; about Coloraydo. Sure, Mr.
Lightfoot is our best story-teller; and he&#8217;s had some
mighty excitin&#8217; times up there in them parts, hain&#8217;t
you, Bill?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill cast a baleful glance at his rival and thrust
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
out his chin insolently. His Coloraydo experiences
were a matter of jest with Jeff Creede, but with the
ladies it might be different. His courage rose before
the flattering solicitude of Kitty Bonnair and he resolved
then and there to fool Mr. Creede or know
the reason why.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied, stoutly, &#8220;they may look kinder
tame alongside of your Arizona lies, but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Lightfoot, <i>do</i> tell me all about it!&#8221; broke
in Kitty, with an alluring smile. &#8220;Colorado is an
awfully wild country, isn&#8217;t it? And did you ever
have any adventures with bears?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bears!&#8221; exclaimed Bill contemptuously. &#8220;Bears!
Huh, we don&#8217;t take no more account of ordinary
bears up in Coloraydo than they do of coons down
here. But them big silver-tips&ndash;&ndash;ump-um&ndash;&ndash;excuse
<i>me</i>!&#8221; He paused and swaggered a little on the
precarious support of his cracker box. &#8220;And yet,
Miss Bunnair,&#8221; he said, lowering his voice to a confidential
key, &#8220;I slept a whole night with one of
them big fellers and never turned a hair. I could&#8217;ve
killed him the next day, too, but I was so grateful to
him I spared his life.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the regular &#8220;come-on&#8221; for Lightfoot&#8217;s
snow-storm story, and Creede showed his white teeth
scornfully as Bill leaned back and began the yarn.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Miss Bunnair,&#8221; began the Colorado cowboy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
rolling his eyes about the circle to quell any
tendency to give him away, &#8220;Coloraydo is an altogether
different country from this here. The mountains
is mighty steep and brushy, with snow on the
peaks, and the cactus ain&#8217;t more &#8217;n a inch high out
on the perairie. But they&#8217;s plenty of feed and water&ndash;&ndash;you
betcher life I wisht I was back there now instead
of fightin&#8217; sheep down here! The only thing
aginst that country up there is the blizzards. Them
storms is very destructive to life. Yes, ma&#8217;am.
They&#8217;s never any notice given but suddenly the wind
will begin to blow and the cattle will begin to drift,
and then about the time your horse is give out and
your ears frozen it&#8217;ll begin to snow!</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this time I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; about I was up on the
Canadian River west of the Medicine Bow Mountains
and she came on to snow&ndash;&ndash;and snow, I thought it
would bury me alive! I was lost in a big park&ndash;&ndash;a
kind of plain or perairie among the mountains.
Yes&#8217;m, they have&#8217;m there&ndash;&ndash;big level places&ndash;&ndash;and it
was thirty miles across this here level perairie. The
wind was blowin&#8217; something awful and the snow just
piled up on my hat like somebody was shovellin&#8217; it off
a roof, but I kept strugglin&#8217; on and tryin&#8217; to git to
the other side, or maybe find some sheltered place,
until it was like walkin&#8217; in your sleep. And that
light fluffy snow jest closed in over me until I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
covered up ten feet deep. Of course my horse had
give out long ago, and I was jest beginnin&#8217; to despair
when I come across one of them big piles of rocks
they have up there, scattered around promiscus-like
on the face of nature; and I begin crawlin&#8217; in and
crawlin&#8217; in, hopin&#8217; to find some cave or somethin&#8217;,
and jest as I was despairin&#8217; my feet fell into a kind
of trail, kinder smooth and worn, but old, you know,
and stomped hard under the snow. Well, I follers
along this path with my feet until it come to a hole
in the rocks; and when I come to that hole I went
right in, fer I was desprit; and I crawled in and
crawled in until I come to a big nest of leaves, and
then I begin to burrow down into them leaves. And
as soon as I had made a hole I pulled them leaves
over me and fell to sleep, I was that exhausted.</p>
<p>&#8220;But after a while I had some awful bad dreams,
and when I woke up I felt somethin&#8217; kickin&#8217; under
me. Yes &#8217;m, that&#8217;s right; I felt somethin&#8217; kinder
movin&#8217; around and squirmin&#8217;, and when I begin to
investergate I found I was layin&#8217; down right square
on top of a tremenjous big grizzly bear! Well, you
fellers can laugh, but I was, all the same. What do
you know about it, you woolies, punchin&#8217; cows down
here in the rocks and cactus?</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that, Miss Bunnair? W&#8217;y sure, he was
hibernatin&#8217;! They all hibernate up in them cold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
countries. Well, the funny part of this was that
Old Brin had gone to sleep suckin&#8217; his off fore foot,
jest like a little baby, and when I had piled in on top
of him I had knocked his paw out of his mouth and he
was tryin&#8217; to git it back. But he was all quilled up
with himself under them leaves, and his claws was so
long he couldn&#8217;t git that foot back into his mouth
nohow. He snooped and grabbed and fumbled, and
every minute he was gittin&#8217; madder and madder, a-suckin&#8217;
and slobberin&#8217; like a calf tryin&#8217; to draw milk
out of the hired man&#8217;s thumb, and a-gruntin&#8217; and
groanin&#8217; somethin&#8217; awful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I see my finish in about a minute if he ever
got good an&#8217; woke up, so I resolved to do somethin&#8217;
desprit. I jest naturally grabbed onto that foot and
twisted it around and stuck it into his mouth myself!
Afraid? Ump-um, not me&ndash;&ndash;the only thing I was
afraid of was that he&#8217;d git my hand and go to suckin&#8217;
it by mistake. But when I steered his paw around
in front of him he jest grabbed onto that big black
pad on the bottom of his foot like it was m&#8217;lasses
candy, and went off to sleep again as peaceful as a
kitten.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man from Coloraydo ended his tale abruptly,
with an air of suspense, and Kitty Bonnair took the
cue.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I do then?&#8221; demanded Lightfoot, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
a reminiscent smile. &#8220;Well, it was a ground-hog case
with me&ndash;&ndash;if I moved I&#8217;d freeze to death and if I
knocked his paw out&#8217;n his mouth again he&#8217;d mash
my face in with it&ndash;&ndash;so I jest snuggled down against
him, tucked my head under his chin, and went to
sleep, holdin&#8217; that paw in his mouth with both
hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Lightfoot,&#8221; exclaimed Kitty, &#8220;how could
you? Why, that&#8217;s the most remarkable experience
I ever heard of! Lucy, I&#8217;m going to put that story
in my book when I get home, and&ndash;&ndash;but what <i>are</i> you
laughing at, Mr. Creede?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who? Me?&#8221; inquired Jeff, who had been rocking
about as if helpless with laughter. &#8220;W&#8217;y, <i>I</i> ain&#8217;t
laughin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you are too!&#8221; accused Miss Kitty. &#8220;And I
want you to tell me what it is. Don&#8217;t you think Mr.
Lightfoot&#8217;s story is true?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True?&#8221; echoed Creede, soberly. &#8220;W&#8217;y, sure it&#8217;s
true. I ain&#8217;t never been up in those parts; but if Bill
says so, that settles it. I never knew a feller from
Coloraydo yet that could tell a lie. No, I was jest
laughin&#8217; to think of that old bear suckin&#8217; his paw that
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added this last with such an air of subterfuge
and evasion that Kitty was not deceived for a
moment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re <i>not</i>, Mr. Creede,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you&#8217;re
just making fun of me&ndash;&ndash;so there!&#8221;</p>
<p>She stamped her foot and pouted prettily, and the
big cowboy&#8217;s face took on a look of great concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;but since it&#8217;s gone
so far I reckon I&#8217;ll have to come through now in
order to square myself. Of course I never had no
real adventures, you know,&ndash;&ndash;nothin&#8217; that you would
care to write down or put in a book, like Bill&#8217;s,&ndash;&ndash;but
jest hearin&#8217; him tell that story of gittin&#8217; snowed in
reminded me of a little experience I had up north
here in Coconino County. You know Arizona ain&#8217;t
all sand and cactus&ndash;&ndash;not by no means. Them San
Francisco Mountains up above Flag are sure snow-crested
and covered with tall timber and it gits so
cold up there in the winter-time that it breaks rocks.
No, that&#8217;s straight! Them prospectors up there
when they run short of powder jest drill a line of
holes in a rock and when one of them awful cold snaps
comes on they run out and fill the holes up with hot
water out of the tea-kittle. Well, sir, when that water
freezes, which it does in about a minute, it jest
naturally busts them rocks wide open&ndash;&ndash;but that ain&#8217;t
what I started to tell you about.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and contemplated his hearers with impressive
dignity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cold ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217;,&#8221; he continued gravely, &#8220;after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
you git used to it; but once in a while, ladies, she
snows up there. And when I say &#8216;snows&#8217; I don&#8217;t
refer to such phenominer as Bill was tellin&#8217; about up
in Coloraydo, but the real genuwine Arizona article&ndash;&ndash;the
kind that gits started and can&#8217;t stop, no more &#8217;n a
cloudburst. Well, one time I was knockin&#8217; around
up there in Coconino when I ought to&#8217;ve been at
home, and I come to a big plain or perairie that was
<i>seventy miles across</i>, and I got lost on that big plain,
right in the dead of winter. They was an awful cold
wind blowin&#8217; at the time, but I could see the mountains
on the other side and so I struck out for &#8217;em.
But jest as I got in the middle of that great plain or
perairie, she come on to snow. At first she come
straight down, kinder soft and fluffy; then she began
to beat in from the sides, and the flakes began to git
bigger and bigger, until I felt like the Chinaman that
walked down Main Street when they had that snow-storm
in Tucson. Yes, sir, it was jest like havin&#8217;
every old whiskey bum in town soakin&#8217; you with
snow-balls&ndash;&ndash;and all the kids thrown in.</p>
<p>&#8220;My horse he began to puff and blow and the snow
began to bank up higher and higher in front of us
and on top of us until, bymeby, he couldn&#8217;t stand no
more, and he jest laid down and died. Well, of
course that put me afoot and I was almost despairin&#8217;.
The snow was stacked up on top of me about ten feet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
deep and I was desprit, but I kept surgin&#8217; right
ahead, punchin&#8217; a hole through that fluffy stuff, until
she was twenty foot deep. But I wasn&#8217;t afraid none&ndash;&ndash;ump-um,
not me&ndash;&ndash;I jest kept a-crawlin&#8217; and a-crawlin&#8217;,
hopin&#8217; to find some rocks or shelter, until
she stacked up on top of me thirty foot deep. <i>Thirty
foot</i>&ndash;&ndash;and slumped down on top o&#8217; me until I felt
like a horny-toad under a haystack. Well, I was
gittin&#8217; powerful weak and puny, but jest as I was
despairin&#8217; I come across a big rock, right out there in
the middle of that great plain or perairie. I tried
to crawl around that old rock but the snow was pushin&#8217;
down so heavy on top o&#8217; me I couldn&#8217;t do nothin&#8217;,
and so when she was <i>fif-ty-two foot deep</i> by actual
measurement I jest give out an&#8217; laid down to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and fixed a speculative eye on Bill
Lightfoot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that would be considered pretty deep up
in Coloraydo,&#8221; he suggested, and then he began to
roll a cigarette. Sitting in rigid postures before the
fire the punchers surveyed his face with slow and suspicious
glances; and for once Kitty Bonnair was
silent, watching his deliberate motions with a troubled
frown. Balanced rakishly upon his cracker box Bill
Lightfoot regarded his rival with a sneering smile, a
retort trembling on his lips, but Creede only leaned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
forward and picked a smoking brand from the fire&ndash;&ndash;he
was waiting for the &#8220;come-on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now to ask the expected question at the end of
such a story was to take a big chance. Having been
bitten a time or two all around, the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> hands were
wary of Jeff Creede and his barbed jests; the visitors,
being ignorant, were still gaping expectantly; it was
up to Bill Lightfoot to spring the mine. For a
moment he hesitated, and then his red-hot impetuosity,
which had often got him into trouble before, carried
him away.</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y, sure it would be deep for Coloraydo,&#8221; he
answered, guardedly.</p>
<p>Jefferson Creede glanced up at him, smoking
luxuriously, holding the cigarette to his lips with his
hand as if concealing a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, rats,&#8221; snapped out Lightfoot at last, &#8220;why
don&#8217;t you finish up and quit? What happened then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then?&#8221; drawled Creede, with a slow smile. &#8220;W&#8217;y,
nothin&#8217;, Bill&ndash;&ndash;<i>I died</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah-hah-hah!&#8221; yelled the punchers, throwing up
handfuls of dirt in the extravagance of their delight,
and before Bill could realize the enormity of the sell
one of his own partisans rose up and kicked the
cracker box out from under him in token of utter
defeat. For an hour after their precipitate retreat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
the visitors could hear the whoops and gibes of the
cowboys, the loud-mouthed and indignant retorts of
Lightfoot, and the soothing remonstrances of Jefferson
Creede&ndash;&ndash;and from the house Kitty the irrepressible,
added to their merriment a shriek of silvery
laughter. But after it was all over and he had won,
the round-up boss swore soberly at himself and
sighed, for he discerned on the morrow&#8217;s horizon the
Indian signs of trouble.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>FOREBODINGS</h3>
</div>
<p>To the Eastern eye, blinded by local color, the Four
Peaks country looked like a large and pleasantly
variegated cactus garden, sparsely populated with rollicking,
fun-loving cowboys who wore their interesting
six-shooters solely to keep their balance in the
saddle. The new grass stood untrampled beneath the
bushes on Bronco Mesa, there were buds and flowers
everywhere, and the wind was as sweet and untainted
as if it drew out of Eden. But somewhere, somewhere
in that great wilderness of peaks which lay to the
south and through which only the dogged sheepmen
could fight their way, stealthily hidden, yet watching,
lay Jasper Swope and his sheep. And not only
Jasper with his pet man-killing Chihuahuano and all
those low-browed <i>compadres</i> whom he called by circumlocution
&#8220;brothers,&#8221; but Jim, sore with his defeat,
and many others&ndash;&ndash;and every man armed.</p>
<p>After the first rain they had disappeared from
the desert absolutely, their tracks pointing toward the
east. The drought had hit them hard, and the cold of
Winter; yet the ewes had lambed in the springtime,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
and as if by magic the tender grass shot up to feed
their little ones. Surely, God was good to the sheep.
They were ranging far, now that the shearing was
over, but though they fed to the topmost peaks of the
Superstitions, driving the crooked-horned mountain
sheep from their pastures, their destiny lay to the
north, in the cool valleys of the Sierra Blancas; and
there in the end they would go, though they left havoc
in their wake. Once before the sheep had vanished
in this same way, mysteriously; and at last, travelling
circuitous ways and dealing misery to many Tonto
cowmen, they had poured over the very summit of the
Four Peaks and down upon Bronco Mesa. And
now, though they were hidden, every man on the
round-up felt their presence and knew that the upper
range was in jeopardy.</p>
<p>After amusing the ladies with inconsequential tales,
the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> outfit therefore rose up and was gone before
the light, raking the exposed lowland for its toll of
half-fed steers; and even Rufus Hardy, the parlor-broke
friend and lover, slipped away before any of
them were stirring and rode far up along the river.
What a river it was now, this unbridled Salagua which
had been their moat and rampart for so many years!
Its waters flowed thin and impotent over the rapids,
lying in clear pools against the base of the black cliffs,
and the current that had uprooted trees like feathers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
was turned aside by a snag. Where before the sheep
had hung upon its flank hoping at last to swim at
Hidden Water, the old ewes now strayed along its
sandy bed, browsing upon the willows. From the
towering black buttes that walled in Hell&#8217;s Hip
Pocket to the Rio Verde it was passable for a spring
lamb, and though the thin grass stood up fresh and
green on the mesas the river showed nothing but
drought. Drought and the sheep, those were the twin
evils of the Four Peaks country; they lowered the
price of cattle and set men to riding the range restlessly.
For the drought is a visitation of God, to be
accepted and endured, but sheep may be turned back.</p>
<p>As he rode rapidly along the river trail, halting on
each ridge to search the landscape for sheep, Hardy&#8217;s
conscience smote him for the single day he had spent
in camp, dallying within sight of Kitty or talking with
Lucy Ware. One such day, if the sheepmen were
prepared, and Bronco Mesa would be a desert.
Threats, violence, strategy, would be of no avail, once
the evil was done; the sheep must be turned back at
the river or they would swarm in upon the whole
upper range. One man could turn them there, for it
was the dead line; but once across they would scatter
like quail before a hawk, crouching and hiding in
the gulches, refusing to move, yet creeping with brutish
stubbornness toward the north and leaving a clean
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
swath behind. There were four passes that cut their
way down from the southern mountains to the banks
of the river, old trails of Apaches and wild game, and
to quiet his mind Hardy looked for tracks at every
crossing before he turned Chapuli&#8217;s head toward
camp.</p>
<p>The smoke was drifting from the chimney when,
late in the afternoon, he rode past the door and saw
Lucy Ware inside, struggling with an iron kettle
before the fireplace. Poor Lucy, she had undertaken
a hard problem, for there is as much difference
between camp cooking and home cooking as there
is between a Dutch oven and a steel range, and a
cooking-school graduate has to forget a whole lot before
she can catch the knack of the open fire. For the
second time that day Rufus Hardy&#8217;s conscience, so
lately exercised over his neglect of the sheep, rose
up and rebuked him. Throwing Chapuli into the
corral he kicked off his spurs and shaps and gave
Lucy her first lesson in frontier cookery; taught her
by the force of his example how to waste her wood
and save her back; and at the end of the short demonstration
he sat down without ceremony, and fell to
eating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if I seem to be greedy, but
I had my breakfast before sun-up. Where&#8217;s your
father, and Kitty?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they had the Mexican boy catch their horses
for them and have ridden up the valley to watch for
the cattle. I stayed behind to make my first water
color, and then&ndash;&ndash;I thought you would be coming
back soon, so I tried to cook supper instead. I&#8217;m
a pretty good housekeeper&ndash;&ndash;at home,&#8221; she said
apologetically.</p>
<p>Hardy watched her as she experimented painstakingly
with the fire, scooping out shovelfuls of coal
from beneath the glowing logs and planting her pots
and kettles upon them with a hooked stick, according
to instructions.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look like a picture of one of our sainted
Puritan ancestors,&#8221; he observed, at last, &#8220;and that&#8217;s
just exactly the way they cooked, too&ndash;&ndash;over an open
fire. How does it feel to be Priscilla?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if Priscilla&#8217;s hands looked like mine,&#8221; exclaimed
Lucy despairingly, &#8220;John Alden must have
been madly in love with her. How <i>do</i> you keep yours
clean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a secret,&#8221; replied Hardy, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll tell
you. I never touch the outside of a pot&ndash;&ndash;and I
scour them with sandsoap. But I wish you&#8217;d stop
cooking, Lucy; it makes me feel conscience-stricken.
You are my guests, remember, even if I do go off and
neglect you for a whole day; and when you go back to
Berkeley I want you to have something more interesting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
than housekeeping to talk about. Didn&#8217;t I see
two ladies&#8217; saddles out in the wagon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Lucy&#8217;s eyes lighted up with pleasure as, anticipating
his drift, she nodded her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then,&#8221; said Hardy, with finality, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll
get up early in the morning, I&#8217;ll catch you a little
pony that I gentled myself, and we can ride up the
river together. How does that strike you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; exclaimed Lucy, with sudden enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Rufus,&#8221; she cried impulsively, &#8220;if you only
knew how weak and helpless a thing it is to be a
woman&ndash;&ndash;and how glad we are to be noticed! Why,
I was just thinking before you came in that about the
only really helpful thing a woman could do in this
world was just to stay around home and cook the
meals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you just let me cook those meals for a
while,&#8221; said Rufus, with brotherly authority, &#8220;and
come out and be a man for a change. Can you ride
pretty well?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy glanced at him questioningly, and thought
she read what was in his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I can ride, but&ndash;&ndash;but I just
couldn&#8217;t bring myself to dress like Kitty!&#8221; she burst
out. &#8220;I know it&#8217;s foolish, but I can&#8217;t bear to have
people notice me so. But I&#8217;ll be a man in everything
else, if you&#8217;ll only give me a chance.&#8221; She stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
before him, radiant, eager, her eyes sparkling like a
child&#8217;s, and suddenly Hardy realized how much she
lost by being always with Kitty. Seen by herself
she was as lithe and graceful as a fairy, with a steady
gaze very rare in women, and eyes which changed like
the shadows in a pool, answering every mood in wind
and sky, yet always with their own true light. Her
cheeks glowed with the fresh color which her father&#8217;s
still retained, and she had inherited his generous
nature, too; but in mind and stature she took after
her dainty mother, whose exquisite grace and beauty
had made her one of the elect. Perhaps it was this
quality of the petite in her which appealed to him&ndash;&ndash;for
a little man cannot endure to be laughed at for
his size, even in secret&ndash;&ndash;or perhaps it was only the
intuitive response to a something which in his prepossession
he only vaguely sensed, but Rufus Hardy
felt his heart go out to her in a moment and his voice
sank once more to the caressing fulness which she
most loved to hear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Lucy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you need never try to be a
man in order to ride with me. It would be hard luck
if a woman like you had to ask twice for anything.
Will you go out with me every day? No? Then I
shall ask you every day, and you shall go whenever
you please! But you know how it is. The sheepmen
are hiding along the river waiting for a chance to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
sneak across, and if I should stay in camp for a
single day they might make a break&ndash;&ndash;and then we
would have a war. Your father doesn&#8217;t understand
that, but I do; and I know that Jeff will never submit
to being sheeped out without a fight. Can&#8217;t you
see how it is? I should like to stay here and entertain
you, and yet I must protect your father&#8217;s cattle, and
I must protect Jeff. But if you will ride out with
me when it is not too hot, I&ndash;&ndash;it&ndash;&ndash;well, you&#8217;ll go to-morrow,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose and took her hand impulsively, and then
as quickly dropped it and turned away. The
muffled <i>chuck, chuck,</i> of a horse&#8217;s feet stepping past
the door smote upon his ear, and a moment later a
clear voice hailed them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>are</i> you children chattering about in
there?&#8221; cried Kitty Bonnair, and Hardy, after a
guilty silence, replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;The ways of the weary world. Won&#8217;t you come
in and have the last word?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stepped out and held Pinto by the head, and
Kitty dropped off and sank wearily into a rawhide
chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m too tired to talk, riding around trying
to find those cattle&ndash;&ndash;and just as I was tired out we
saw them coming, away out on The Rolls. Lucy, do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
put on your riding habit and go back on Pinto&ndash;&ndash;you
haven&#8217;t been out of the house to-day!&#8221;</p>
<p>As half an hour later Lucy Ware trotted
obediently away, riding up the ca&ntilde;on toward the
distant bawling of cattle, Kitty turned suddenly
upon Hardy with half-closed, accusing eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to be very happy with Lucy,&#8221; she said,
with an aggrieved smile. &#8220;But why,&#8221; she continued,
with quickening animus, &#8220;why should you seek to
avoid me? Isn&#8217;t it enough that I should come clear
down here to see you? But when I want to have a
word with you after our long silence I have to scheme
and manage like a gypsy!&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused, and flicked her booted leg with the
lash of a horsehair quirt, glancing at him furtively
with eyes that drooped with an appealing sadness.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had known how hard-hearted you could be,&#8221;
she said, after a silence, &#8220;I should never have spoken
as I did, if the words choked me. But now that
I have come part way and offered my poor friendship
again, you might&ndash;&ndash;oh Rufus, how could you be
so inconsiderate! No one can ever know what I
suffered when you left that way. Every one knew
we were the best of friends, and several people even
knew that you had been to see me. And then, without
a word, without a sign, with no explanation, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
leave and be gone for years&ndash;&ndash;think what they
must have thought! Oh, it was too humiliating!&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused again, and to Hardy&#8217;s apprehensive
eyes she seemed on the verge of tears. So he spoke,
blindly and without consideration, filled with a man&#8217;s
anxiety to stave off this final catastrophe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he began, though he had never
meant to say it, &#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;but there was nothing else
to do! You&ndash;&ndash;you told me to go. You said you
never wanted to see me again, and&ndash;&ndash;you were not
very kind to me, then.&#8221; He paused, and at the
memory of those last words of hers, uttered long
ago, the flush of shame mantled his cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every man has his limit,&#8221; he said bluntly, &#8220;and
I am no dog, to be scolded and punished and sent
away. I have been ashamed many times for what
I did, but I had to keep my own respect&ndash;&ndash;and so
I left. Is it too much for a man to go away when
he is told?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kitty Bonnair fixed him with her dark eyes and
shook her head sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Rufus,&#8221; she sighed, &#8220;when will you ever
learn that a woman does not always mean all she
says? When you had made me so happy by your
tender consideration&ndash;&ndash;for you could be considerate
when you chose&ndash;&ndash;I said that I loved you; and I
did, but not in the way you thought. I did mean it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
at the moment, from my heart, but not for life&ndash;&ndash;it
was no surrender, no promise&ndash;&ndash;I just loved you for
being so good and kind. But when, taking advantage
of what I said in a moment of weakness, you
tried to claim that which I had never given, I&ndash;&ndash;I
said more than I meant again. Don&#8217;t you understand?
I was hurt, and disappointed, and I spoke
without thinking, but you must not hold that against
me forever! And after I have come clear down here&ndash;&ndash;to
avoid me&ndash;&ndash;to always go out with Lucy and
leave me alone&ndash;&ndash;to force me to arrange a meeting&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped, and Hardy shifted uneasily in his
seat. In his heart of hearts he had realized from the
first his inequality in this losing battle. He was
like a man who goes into a contest conquered already
by his ineptitude at arms&ndash;&ndash;and Kitty would have
her way! Never but once had he defied her power,
and that had been more a flight than a victory. There
was fighting blood in his veins, but it turned to water
before her. He despised himself for it; but all the
while, in a shifting, browbeaten way, he was seeking
for an excuse to capitulate.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Kitty,&#8221; he pleaded, &#8220;be reasonable. I have
my duties down here&ndash;&ndash;the sheep are trying to come
in on us&ndash;&ndash;I have to patrol the river. This morning
before you were awake I was in the saddle, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
now I have just returned. To-morrow I shall be
off again, so how can I arrange a meeting?&#8221;</p>
<p>He held out his hands to her appealingly, carried
away by the force of his own logic.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might at least invite me to go with you,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Unless you expect me to spend all my time
getting lost with Judge Ware,&#8221; she added, with a
plaintive break in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes&ndash;&ndash;yes,&#8221; began Hardy haltingly. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I
have asked Lucy to go with me to-morrow,
but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you&ndash;&ndash;thank you!&#8221; burst out Kitty
mockingly. &#8220;But what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I thought you might like to come along
too,&#8221; suggested Hardy awkwardly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What? And rob her of all her pleasure?&#8221; Kitty
smiled bitterly as she turned upon him. &#8220;Why,
Rufus Hardy,&#8221; she exclaimed, indignantly, &#8220;and she
just dotes on every word you say! Yes, she does&ndash;&ndash;any
one can see that she simply adores you. I declare,
Rufus, your lack of perception would make an
angel weep&ndash;&ndash;especially if it was a lady angel.
But you may as well understand once and for all
that I will never deprive dear, patient, long-suffering
Lucy of anything she sets her heart on. No, I
will <i>not</i> go with you the next day. If you haven&#8217;t
consideration enough to invite me first, I have sense
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
enough to stay away. It was only yesterday that
you took Lucy up to Hidden Water, and to-day I
find you with her again; and to-morrow&ndash;&ndash;well, I
perceive that I must amuse myself down here. But&ndash;&ndash;oh,
look, look! There&#8217;s a cowboy&ndash;&ndash;up on that
high cliff!&#8221;</p>
<p>She started up, pointing at a horseman who was
spurring furiously along the side of the ca&ntilde;on after
a runaway steer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, look!&#8221; she cried again, as Hardy surveyed him
indifferently. &#8220;He is whirling his lasso. Oh! He
has thrown it over that big cow&#8217;s horns! Goodness
me, where is my horse? No, I am going on foot,
then! Oh, Lucy&ndash;&ndash;Lucy dear,&#8221; she screamed, waving
her hand wildly, &#8220;do let me have Pinto, just for
a moment! All right&ndash;&ndash;and Lucy&ndash;&ndash;wasn&#8217;t that
Mr. Creede?&#8221; She lingered on the ground long
enough to give her an ecstatic kiss and then swung
up into the saddle. &#8220;Yes, I knew it&ndash;&ndash;and isn&#8217;t he
just perfectly grand on that big horse? Oh, I&#8217;ve
been wanting to see this all my life&ndash;&ndash;and I owe it
all to you!&#8221;</p>
<p>With a smile and a gay salutation, she leaned
forward and galloped out into the riot and confusion
of the <i>rod&eacute;o</i>, skirting the edge of the bellowing herd
until she disappeared in the dust. And somehow,
even by the childlike obliviousness with which she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
scampered away, she managed to convey a pang to
her errant lover which clutched at his heart for days.</p>
<p>And what days those were for Jefferson Creede!
Deep and devious as was his knowledge of men in the
rough, the ways of a woman in love were as cryptic
to him as the poems of Browning. The first day
that Miss Kitty rode forth to be a cowboy it was the
<i>rod&eacute;o</i> boss, indulgent, but aware of the tenderfoot&#8217;s
ability to make trouble, who soberly assigned his fair
disciple to guard a pass over which no cow could
possibly come. And Kitty, sensing the deceit, had as
soberly amused herself by gathering flowers among
the rocks. But the next day, having learned her
first lesson, she struck for a job to ride, and it was
the giddy-headed lover who permitted her to accompany
him&ndash;&ndash;although not from any obvious or selfish
motives.</p>
<p>Miss Bonnair was the guest of the ranch, her life
and welfare being placed for the time in the keeping
of the boss. What kind of a foreman would it be
who would turn her over to a hireling or intrust her
innocent mind to a depraved individual like Bill
Lightfoot? And all the decent cowmen were scared
of her, so who was naturally indicated and elected but
Jefferson D. Creede?</p>
<p>There wasn&#8217;t any branding at the round corral
that night. The gather was a fizzle, for some reason,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
though Miss Kitty rode Pinto to a finish and killed
a rattlesnake with Creede&#8217;s own gun. Well, they
never did catch many cattle the first few days,&ndash;&ndash;after
they had picked up the tame bunch that hung around
the water,&ndash;&ndash;and the dry weather seemed to have
driven the cows in from The Rolls. But when they
came in the second afternoon, with only a half of
their gather, Creede rode out from the hold-up herd
to meet them, looking pretty black.</p>
<p>It is the duty of a <i>rod&eacute;o</i> boss to know what is
going on, if he has to ride a horse to death to find out;
and the next day, after sending every man down his
ridge, Jeff left Kitty Bonnair talking lion hunt
with old Bill Johnson who had ridden clear over
from Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket to gaze upon this horse-riding
Diana, and disappeared. As a result, Bat
Wings was lathered to a fine dirt-color and there
was one man in particular that the boss wanted to
see.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; he said, riding up to where one of the Clark
boys was sullenly lashing the drag with his <i>reata</i>,
&#8220;what in the hell do you mean by lettin&#8217; all them
cattle get away? Yes, you did too. I saw you tryin&#8217;
to turn &#8217;em back, so don&#8217;t try to hand me anything
like that. I used to think you was a good puncher,
Jim, but a man that can&#8217;t keep a herd of cows from
goin&#8217; through a box pass ought to be smokin&#8217; cigarettes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
on the day herd. You bet ye! All you had to
do was be there&ndash;&ndash;and that&#8217;s jest exactly where you
wasn&#8217;t! I was up on top of that rocky butte, and I
know. You was half a mile up the ca&ntilde;on mousin&#8217;
around in them cliffs, that&#8217;s where you was, and the
only question I want to ask is, Did you find the Lost
Dutchman? No? Then what in hell was you
doin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>The <i>rod&eacute;o</i> boss crowded his horse in close and
thrust his face forward until he could look him
squarely in the eye, and Clark jerked back his head
resentfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it to you?&#8221; he demanded belligerently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nawthin&#8217;,&#8221; returned the boss lightly, &#8220;jest
wanted to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uhr!&#8221; grunted the cowboy contemptuously.
&#8220;Well, I was killin&#8217; snakes, then! What ye goin&#8217;
to do about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Snakes!&#8221; cried Creede incredulously. &#8220;Killin&#8217;
snakes! Since when did you call a feud on them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since thet young lady come,&#8221; replied Clark,
glancing around to see if any one had the nerve to
laugh. &#8220;I heerd her say she was collectin&#8217; rattles;
an&#8217; I thought, while I was waitin&#8217;, I might as well
rustle up a few. Oh, you don&#8217;t need to look pop-eyed&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;s
others!&#8221;</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes significantly at the group of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
assembled cowboys, and Creede took it all in at a
flash. There <i>were</i> others&ndash;&ndash;he himself had a set of
rattles in his shap pocket that were not two hours
from the stump. The situation called for diplomacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he drawled, scratching his bushy head to
cover his confusion, &#8220;this reflects great credit on your
bringin&#8217; up, Jim, and I&#8217;m sure Miss Bonnair will
appreciate what you&#8217;ve done for her, especially as I
happened to notice a couple o&#8217; head of your own cows
in that bunch, but it&#8217;s a mighty expensive way to
collect snake-tails. We ain&#8217;t gittin&#8217; the cattle, boys;
that&#8217;s the size of it, and they&#8217;re as much yours as they
are mine. Now I suggest that we run these few
we&#8217;ve got down to the corral and brand &#8217;em quick&ndash;&ndash;and
then the whole shootin&#8217;-match goes over to the
big white cliff and rounds up every rattlesnake in the
rock pile! Is it a go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; yelled the bunch impetuously, and as they
charged down upon the herd Creede quietly fished
out his snake-tail and dropped it in the dirt.</p>
<p>If he lacked a virtue he could feign it, anyhow&ndash;&ndash;but
there was no doubt about it, Miss Kitty was putting
his <i>rod&eacute;o</i> on the bum. There had never been so
many men to feed and so few calves to brand in the
history of Hidden Water. Even old Bill Johnson had
got the fever from hearing the boys talk and was hanging
around the fire. But then, what were a few head
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
of cows compared to&ndash;&ndash;well, what was it, anyway?
The only man who could stay away was Rufe, and he
was in good company.</p>
<p>Yet Creede was not satisfied with this explanation.
Miss Kitty was always asking questions about
Rufe&ndash;&ndash;they had known each other well in Berkeley&ndash;&ndash;and
at the same time the little partner with whom
he had been so friendly never came around any more.
He was always very polite, and she called him by
his first name&ndash;&ndash;and then one of them rode up the
river and the other followed the round-up.</p>
<p>The night after the big snake-killing Jefferson
Creede picked up his blankets and moved quietly
back to the <i>ramada</i> with Hardy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them locoed punchers have been skinnin&#8217; rattlers
and stretchin&#8217; their hides,&#8221; he said, &#8220;until the camp
stinks like a buzzard roost. I&#8217;m due to have some
bad dreams to-night anyhow, on the strength of this
snake-killin&#8217;, but it&#8217;d give me the jumpin&#8217; jimjams
if I had to sleep next to them remains. Didn&#8217;t git
back in time to join in, did ye? Well, no great loss.
I always did intend to clean out that snake hole
over&#8217;n the cliff, and the boys was stoppin&#8217; every time
they heard one sing, anyhow, in order to git the rattles
for Miss Bonnair, so I thought we might as well git
it off our minds before somethin&#8217; worse turned up.
See any sheep tracks?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></div>
<p>He kicked off his boots, poked his six-shooter under
his pillow, and settled down comfortably for the
night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nary one, eh?&#8221; he repeated musingly. &#8220;Well,
when you see one you&#8217;ll see a million&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s been
my experience. But say, Rufe, why don&#8217;t you come
and ride with the boys once in a while? The <i>rod&eacute;o</i>
has been goin&#8217; rotten this year&ndash;&ndash;we ain&#8217;t gittin&#8217;
half of &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;and you&#8217;d come in mighty handy.
Besides, I&#8217;ve been braggin&#8217; you up to Miss Bonnair.&#8221;</p>
<p>He dropped this last as a bait, but Hardy did not
respond.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told her you was the best bronco-buster in the
Four Peaks country,&#8221; continued Creede deliberately,
&#8220;and that you could drift Chapuli over the rocks
like a sand lizard; but I&#8217;m too heavy for anything
like that now, and Bill Lightfoot has been puttin&#8217;
up the fancy work, so far. You know how I like
Bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more he waited for an answer, but Hardy
was wrestling with those elementary passions which
have been making trouble since Helen of Troy left
home, and he received the remark in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, Rufe,&#8221; said Creede, lowering his
voice confidentially. &#8220;Of course I see how it is with
you and Miss Ware, and I&#8217;m glad of it; but things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; so lovely for me. It ain&#8217;t my fault if
Miss Bonnair happens to like my company, but Bill
and some of the other boys have got their backs up
over it, and they&#8217;ve practically gone on a strike.
Leastwise we ain&#8217;t gittin&#8217; the cattle, and God knows
the range won&#8217;t more &#8217;n carry what&#8217;s left. I&#8217;ve got
to git out and do some ridin&#8217;, and at the same time
I want to do the right thing by Miss Bonnair, so if
you could jest kindly come along with us to-morrow
I&#8217;ll be much obliged.&#8221;</p>
<p>The elemental passions&ndash;&ndash;man-love, jealousy,
the lust for possession&ndash;&ndash;are ugly things at best, even
when locked in the bosom of a poet. In their simplest
terms they make for treachery and stealth; but when
complicated with the higher call of friendship and
duty they gall a man like the chains of Prometheus
and send the dragon-clawed eagles of Jove to tear at
his vitals. Never until this naive confession had
Hardy suspected the sanity of his friend nor the constancy
of Kitty Bonnair. That she was capable of
such an adventure he had never dreamed&ndash;&ndash;and yet&ndash;&ndash;and
yet&ndash;&ndash;where was there a more masterful man
than Jeff? Anything can happen in love; and who
was there more capable of winning a romantic
woman&#8217;s regard than good-natured, impulsive, domineering
Jeff?</p>
<p>The thoughts flashed through his brain with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
rapidity of lightning, and only his instinct of reserve
protected him from his blundering tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I was&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he began, and stopped short.
The idea of loyalty had ruled his mind so long that
it had become a habit, ill suited to the cause of a
jealous lover; and Jeff had confided to him as a
child might run to its mother. Should a man take
advantage of his friend&#8217;s innocence to deprive him of
that for which they both strove? Hardy fought the
devil away and spoke again, quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going up the river to-morrow, Jeff,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Seemed to me I saw a kind of smoke, or dust,
over south of Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket this afternoon&ndash;&ndash;and
we can&#8217;t take any chances now. That would
take all day, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lay still after that, his brain whirling with contending
emotions. Each evening as he listened to
the music of her laughter he had resolved to quit
his lonely watch and snatch from life the pleasure of
a single day with Kitty, such days as they used to
have when he was her unacknowledged lover and all
the world was young. Then he could always please
her. He could bend to her moods like a willow,
braving the storms of her displeasure, which only
drew them closer in the end, secure in the hope of
her ultimate yielding. But now the two barren
years lay between; years which had stiffened his jaw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
and left him rough in his ways; years which had
wrought some change in her, he knew not what. A
single day might solve the crux&ndash;&ndash;nay, it might bring
the great happiness of which he dreamed. But each
morning as he woke with the dawn he saw that
mighty army without banners, the sheep, marching
upon their stronghold, the broad mesa which fed the
last of Jeff&#8217;s cows, and Judge Ware&#8217;s, and Lucy&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;and
sprang from his blankets. And when the sun
rose and Kitty came forth he was far away. But
now&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>He was awakened from his dreams by the voice of
Creede, low, vibrant, full of brotherly love.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rufe,&#8221; he was saying, &#8220;Miss Bonnair has told me
a lot about you&ndash;&ndash;a lot I didn&#8217;t know. She likes you,
boy, and she&#8217;s a good woman. I never knowed but
one like her, and that was Sallie Winship. You
mustn&#8217;t let anything that&#8217;s happened stand between
you. Of course she never said anything&ndash;&ndash;never said
a word&ndash;&ndash;but I&#8217;m wise that way; I can tell by
their voice, and all that. You want to let them
dam&#8217; sheep go for a day or two and git this thing
patched up.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, and Hardy&#8217;s mind whirled backward,
upsetting his fears, unmaking his conclusions. It
was Jeff the friend who spoke, Jeff the peacemaker,
who had stampeded him by the equivocation of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
words. But now the voice broke in again, apologetic,
solicitous, self-seeking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides, that son-of-a-gun, Bill Lightfoot, has
been tryin&#8217; to cut me out.&#8221;</p>
<p>God! There it hit him hard. Kitty, the immaculate,
the exquisite, the friend of poets and artists, the
woman he had loved and cherished in his dreams&ndash;&ndash;striven
for by Jeff and Bill, revelling in the homage
of Mexicans and hard-drinking round-up hands,
whose natural language was astench with uncleanliness.
It was like beholding a dainty flower in the
grime and brutality of the branding pen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Jeff,&#8221; he said, in a far-away voice.
&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d do anything I could for you&ndash;&ndash;but I&#8217;m
afraid of those sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>He dragged miserably through the remnant of
their conversation and then lay staring at the stars
while his hulk of a partner, this great bear who in
his awkward good nature had trampled upon holy
ground, slept peacefully by his side. The Pleiades
fled away before Orion, the Scorpion rose up in
the south and sank again, the Morning Star blinked
and blazed like a distant fire, such as shepherds
kindle upon the ridges, and still Hardy lay in his
blankets, fighting with himself. The great blackness
which precedes the first glow of dawn found him
haggard and weary of the struggle. He rose and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
threw wood on the coals of last night&#8217;s fire, cooked
and ate in silence, and rode away. There was a
great burden upon his soul, a great fire and anger in
his heart, and he questioned the verities of life. He
rode up the river gloomily, searching the southern
wilderness with frowning, bloodshot eyes, and once
more, far to the east where the jagged cliffs of the
Superstitions sweep down to the gorge of the Salagua
and Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket bars the river&#8217;s sweep,
he saw that vague, impalpable haze&ndash;&ndash;a smoke, a
dust, a veil of the lightest skein, stirred idly by some
wandering wind, perhaps, or marking the trail of
sheep. And as he looked upon it his melancholy
gaze changed to a staring, hawk-like intentness; he
leaned forward in the saddle and Chapuli stepped
eagerly down the slope, head up, as if he sniffed the
battle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE CATASTROPHE</h3>
</div>
<p>A demon of unrest, twin devil to that which
had so clutched and torn at the sensitive spirit
of Rufus Hardy, seemed to rise up with the dawn
of that ill-omened day and seize upon the camp at
Hidden Water. It was like a touch of the north
wind, which rumples the cat&#8217;s back, sets the horses
to fighting in the corrals, and makes men mean and
generally contrary. Bill Johnson&#8217;s hounds were the
first to feel the madness. They left before sun-up,
heading for the wooded heights of the Juate, and
led him a weary chase. At the last moment Creede
abandoned the unprofitable working of The Rolls
and ordered the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> up onto Bronco Mesa; and
Kitty Bonnair, taking advantage of his preoccupation,
quietly gave him the slip at the end of their
long eastern detour, and turned her pinto&#8217;s head
toward the river.</p>
<p>As for Kitty, her will was the wind&#8217;s will, which
changes with the times and seasons but is accountable
to no universal law. Never in her life had she met
a man who could quarrel like Rufus Hardy. Beneath
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
her eye he was as clay in the hands of the
potter; every glance spoke love, and for her alone.
And yet it was something more than a smouldering
resentment which made him avoid her, riding
out before the dawn; more than the tremulous
bashfulness which had stayed his hand when at times
he might have taken hers. There was something
deep, hidden, mysterious, lurking in those fawnlike
eyes, and it made him insurgent against her will.
It was a secret, hidden from all the world, which he
must yield to her. And then she would forgive him
for all the unhappiness he had caused her and teach
him what a thing it is for a woman to love and be
misunderstood. But first&ndash;&ndash;first she must see him
alone; she must burst upon him suddenly, taking
his heart by storm as she had on that first day, and
leave the rest to fate. So she lingered to gather
some flowers which nodded among the rocks, the
shy and dainty forget-me-nots which they had picked
together at home; and when Creede was over the
first ridge she struck out boldly up a side ca&ntilde;on,
tucking the miniature bouquet into the shadows of
her hair.</p>
<p>The southern flank of Bronco Mesa breaks off
sharply above the Salagua, rising slowly by slopes
and terraced benches to the heights, and giving way
before the river in a succession of broken ridges.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
Along these summits run winding trails, led high
to escape the rougher ground. Urged on by the
slashings of her quirt, Pinto galloped recklessly
through this maze of cow paths until as if by magic
the great valley lay before them. There in its deep
ca&ntilde;on was the river and the river trail&ndash;&ndash;and a man,
mounted upon a sorrel horse, savagely intent upon
his way. For a minute Kitty studied him curiously
as he hustled along, favoring his horse up the hills
but swinging to the stirrup as he dodged bushes
across the flats; then she flung out her hand impulsively,
and called his name. In a flash he was up
in his saddle, looking. Chapuli tossed his head and
in the act caught a glimpse of the other horse&ndash;&ndash;then
they both stood rigid, gazing in astonishment at the
living statue against the sky. At sight of that witching
figure, beckoning him from the mountain top,
Hardy&#8217;s heart leaped within him and stopped. Once
more the little hand was thrown out against the sky
and a merry voice floated down to him from the sun-touched
heights.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Rufus!&#8221; it called teasingly, and still he sat
gazing up at her. All the untamed passions of his
being surged up and choked his voice&ndash;&ndash;he could not
answer. His head turned and he gazed furtively
over his shoulder to the east, where his duty lay.
Then of his own accord Chapuli stepped from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
trail and began to pick his way soberly up the
hill.</p>
<p>From the high summit of the butte all the world lay
spread out like a panorama,&ndash;&ndash;the slopes and ca&ntilde;ons
of Bronco Mesa, picketed with giant <i>sahuaros</i>; the
silvery course of the river flowing below; the unpeopled
peaks and cliffs of the Superstitions; and a faint
haze-like zephyr, floating upon the eastern horizon.
And there at last the eyes of Rufus Hardy and
Kitty Bonnair met, questioning each other, and the
world below them took on a soft, dreamy veil of
beauty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, how did you come here?&#8221; he asked, looking
down upon her wonderingly. &#8220;Were you
lost?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Kitty smiled wistfully as she answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&ndash;&ndash;till I found you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Hardy, and he studied her face warily,
as if doubtful of her intent.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how could you be lost,&#8221; he asked again, &#8220;and
travel so far? This is a rough country, and you
got here before I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>He swung down from his horse and stood beside
her, but Kitty only laughed mischievously and shook
her head&ndash;&ndash;at which, by some lover&#8217;s magic, the
dainty forget-me-nots fell from her hair in a shower
of snowy blossoms.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I was lost,&#8221; she reiterated, smiling into his eyes,
and in her gaze Hardy could read&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;without you.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment the stern sorrow of the night withheld
him. His eyes narrowed, and he opened his
lips to speak. Then, bowing his head, he knelt and
gathered up the flowers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;I understand. I&ndash;&ndash;I
have been lost, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>They smiled and sat down together in the shadow
of a great rock, gazing out over the peaks and pinnacles
of the mountains which wall in Hidden
Water and talking placidly of the old days&ndash;&ndash;until
at last, when the spell of the past was on
him, Kitty fell silent, waiting for him to speak
his heart.</p>
<p>But instantly the spell of her laughter was broken
an uneasy thought came upon Hardy, and he
glanced up at the soaring sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeff will be worried about you,&#8221; he said at last.
&#8220;He will think you are lost and give up the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> to
hunt for you. We must not stay here so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned his head instinctively as he spoke, and
Kitty knew he was thinking of the sheep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cattle and sheep&ndash;&ndash;cattle and sheep,&#8221; she repeated
slowly. &#8220;Is there nothing else that counts,
Rufus, in all this broad land? Must friendship,
love, companionship, all go down before cattle and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
sheep? I never knew before what a poor creature
a woman was until I came to Arizona.&#8221;</p>
<p>She glanced at him from beneath her drooping
lashes, and saw his jaws set tense.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet only yesterday,&#8221; he said, with a sombre
smile, &#8220;you had twenty men risking their lives to give
you some snake-tails for playthings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But my old friend Rufus was not among them,&#8221;
rejoined Kitty quietly; and once more she watched
the venom working in his blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;he refuses to compete with Bill
Lightfoot at any price.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Rufus,&#8221; cried Kitty, turning upon him
angrily, &#8220;aren&#8217;t you ashamed? I want you to stop
being jealous of all my friends. It is the meanest
and most contemptible thing a man can do. I&ndash;&ndash;I
won&#8217;t stand it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced at her again with the same set look of
disapproval still upon his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kitty,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you knew what lives some
of those men lead&ndash;&ndash;the thoughts they think, the language
they speak&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;you would not&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He
stopped, for the sudden tears were in her eyes.
Kitty was crying.</p>

<p class='caption'>
&#8220;No!&#8221; said Kitty, &#8220;you do not love me&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Rufus,&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;if&ndash;&ndash;if you only knew!
Who else could I go with&ndash;&ndash;how&ndash;&ndash;how else&ndash;&ndash;Oh,
I cannot bear to be scolded and&ndash;&ndash;I only did it to
make you jealous!&#8221; She bowed her head against
her knees and Hardy gazed at her in awe, shame
and compassion sweeping over him as he realized
what she had done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kitty&ndash;&ndash;dear,&#8221; he stammered, striving to unlock
the twisted fingers, &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I didn&#8217;t understand.
Look, here are your flowers and&ndash;&ndash;I love you, Kitty,
if I am a brute.&#8221; He took one hand and held it,
stroking the little fingers which he had so often longed
to caress. But with a sudden wilfulness she turned
her face away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you love me, Kitty?&#8221; he pleaded.
&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you, if I should try to be good and kind?
I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t understand women&ndash;&ndash;I know I have
hurt you&ndash;&ndash;but I loved you all the time. Can&#8217;t
you forgive me, Kitty?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Kitty only shook her head. &#8220;The man I love
must be my master,&#8221; she said, in a far-away voice,
not looking at him. &#8220;He must value me above all
the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Kitty,&#8221; protested Hardy, &#8220;I do&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Kitty, &#8220;you do <i>not</i> love me.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a lash to the words that cut him&ndash;&ndash;a
scorn half-spoken, half-expressed by the slant of her
eye. As he hesitated he felt the hot blood burn
at his brow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rufus,&#8221; she cried, turning upon him quickly, &#8220;<i>do</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
you love me? Then take me in your arms and kiss
me!&#8221; She spoke the words fiercely, almost as a
command, and Hardy started back as if he had been
shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take me in your arms and kiss me!&#8221; she repeated
evenly, a flash of scorn in her eyes. But the
man who had said he loved her faltered and looked
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kitty,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;you know I love you.
But&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221; she demanded sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I have never&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Kitty briefly, &#8220;it&#8217;s all over&ndash;&ndash;you
don&#8217;t have to! I just wanted to show you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; She
paused, and her lip curled as she gazed at him from
a distance. &#8220;Look at my horse,&#8221; she exclaimed suddenly,
pointing to where Pinto was pawing and jerking
at his bridle rein. When Hardy leapt up to
free his foot she frowned again, for that is not the
way of lovers.</p>
<p>He came back slowly, leading the horse, his face
very pale, his eyes set.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Shall we go?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no apology in his voice, no appeal. It
had grown suddenly firm and resonant, and he fixed
her with his great honest eyes steadfastly. Something
in the man seemed to rise up suddenly and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
rebuke her&ndash;&ndash;nay, to declare her unworthy of him.
The thought of those two years&ndash;&ndash;two years without
a word&ndash;&ndash;came upon Kitty and left her sober, filled
with misgivings for the future. She cast about for
some excuse, some reason for delay, and still those
masterful eyes were fixed upon her&ndash;&ndash;sad, wistful,
yet steadfast; and like a child she obeyed them.</p>
<p>It was a long ride to camp, long for both of
them. When he had turned her horse into the corral
Hardy wheeled and rode off up the ca&ntilde;on, where
the hold-up herd was bellowing and there was a man&#8217;s
work to do. There was wild riding that day, such
as Judge Ware and Lucy had never seen before,
and more than one outlaw, loping for the hills, was
roped and thrown, and then lashed back to his place
in the herd. The sensitive spirit of Chapuli responded
like a twin being to the sudden madness
of his master, and the lagging <i>rod&eacute;o</i> hands were
galvanized into action by his impetuous ardor. And
at the end, when the roping and branding were over,
Hardy rode down to the pasture for a fresh mount,
his eyes still burning with a feverish light and his lips
close-drawn and silent.</p>
<p>The outfit was huddled about the fire eating
greedily after the long day, when Creede, furtively
watching his partner, saw his eyes fixed curiously
upon some object in the outer darkness. He followed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
the glance and beheld a hound&ndash;&ndash;gaunt, lame,
beseeching&ndash;&ndash;limping about among the mesquite
trees which lined the edge of the flat.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one of Bill&#8217;s dogs,&#8221; he remarked sociably,
speaking to the crowd in general. &#8220;Must&#8217;ve got
sore-footed and come back. Here, Rock! Here,
Rye! Here, Ring!&#8221; he called, trying the most likely
names. &#8220;Here, puppy&ndash;&ndash;come on, boy!&#8221; And he
scraped a plate in that inviting way which is supposed
to suggest feed to a dog. But Hardy rose up
quietly from his place and went out to the dog. A
moment later he called to Jeff and, after a hurried
conference, the two of them brought the wanderer
up to the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221; called Bill Lightfoot, &#8220;that ain&#8217;t one of
Bill&#8217;s pack&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s old Turco, his home dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I know Bill&#8217;s dogs yet?&#8221; inquired
Creede scathingly. &#8220;Now if you&#8217;ll jest kindly
keep your face shet a minute, I&#8217;ll see what&#8217;s the
matter with this leg.&#8221;</p>
<p>He clamped Turco between his knees and picked
up his fore leg, while the old dog whined and licked
his hands anxiously. There was a stain of blood
from the shoulder down, and above it, cut neatly
through the muscles, a gaping wound.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a thirty-thirty,&#8221; said Creede grimly,
and every man looked up. Thirty-thirty was a sinister
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
number on the range&ndash;&ndash;it was the calibre of a
sheep-herder&#8217;s carbine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, go on,&#8221; scoffed Bill Lightfoot, rushing over
to examine the wound. &#8220;Who could have shot him&ndash;&ndash;away
over in Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s it,&#8221; observed Creede significantly.
&#8220;What you goin&#8217; to do, Rufe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going over there,&#8221; answered Hardy, throwing
the saddle on his horse. He looked over his
shoulder as he heaved on the cinch. &#8220;That&#8217;s where
that dust was,&#8221; he said, and as the outfit stood gaping
he swung up and was off into the darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, take my gun!&#8221; yelled Jeff, but the clatter
of hoofs never faltered&ndash;&ndash;he was going it blind and
unarmed. Late that night another horseman on a
flea-bitten gray dashed madly after him over the
Pocket trail. It was Old Bill Johnson, crazed with
apprehension; and behind him straggled his hounds,
worn from their long chase after the lion, but following
dutifully on their master&#8217;s scent. The rest
of the outfit rode over in the morning&ndash;&ndash;the punchers
with their pistols thrust into the legs of their
shaps; Creede black and staring with anger; the
judge asking a thousand unanswered questions and
protesting against any resort to violence; the women
tagging along helplessly, simply because they could
not be left alone. And there, pouring forth from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
the mouth of Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket, came the sheep, a
solid phalanx, urged on by plunging herders and
spreading out over the broad mesa like an invading
army. Upon the peaks and ridges round about
stood groups of men, like skirmishers&ndash;&ndash;camp
rustlers with their packs and burros; herders, whose
sheep had already passed through&ndash;&ndash;every man with
his gun in his hand. The solid earth of the trail was
worn down and stamped to dust beneath the myriad
feet, rising in a cloud above them as they scrambled
through the pass; and above all other sounds there
rose the high, sustained tremolo of the sheep:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Blay-ay-ay-ay! Blay-ay-ay-ay! Blay-ay-ay-ay!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>To the ears of the herders it was music, like the
thunder of stamps to a miner or the rumble of a
waterfall to a lonely fisher; the old, unlistened music
of their calling, above which the clamor of the world
must fight its way. But to the cowmen it was like all
hell broken loose, a confusion, a madness, a babel
which roused every passion in their being and filled
them with a lust to kill.</p>
<p>Without looking to the right or to the left, Jefferson
Creede fixed his eyes upon one man in that riot
of workers and rode for him as a corral hand marks
down a steer. It was Jasper Swope, hustling the
last of a herd through the narrow defile, and as his
Chihuahuanos caught sight of the burly figure bearing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
down upon the <i>padron</i> they abandoned their
work to help him. From the hill above, Jim Swope,
his face set like iron for the conflict, rode in to back
up his brother; and from far down the ca&ntilde;on Rufus
Hardy came spurring like the wind to take his place
by Creede.</p>
<p>In the elemental clangor of the sheep they faced
each other, Creede towering on his horse, his face
furious with rage; Swope gray with the dust of his
driving but undaunted by the assault.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop where you are!&#8221; shouted Swope, holding
out a warning hand as the cowman showed no sign
of halting. But Creede came straight on, never
flinching, until he had almost ridden him down.</p>
<p>&#8220;You low-lived, sheep-eatin&#8217; hound,&#8221; he hissed,
piling in the wickedest of his range epithets, &#8220;you
and me have had it comin&#8217; fer quite a while, and now
I&#8217;ve got you. I&#8217;ve never yet seen a sheepman that
would fight in the open, but you&#8217;ve got to or take
<i>that</i>!&#8221; He leaned over suddenly and slapped him
with his open hand, laughing recklessly at the Mexicans
as they brandished their guns and shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Quite se, cabrones</i>,&#8221; he jeered, sorting out the
worst of his fighting Spanish for their benefit, &#8220;you
are all gutter pups&ndash;&ndash;you are afraid to shoot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; rasped out Jim Swope, spurring his horse
in between them, &#8220;what are you fellers tryin&#8217; to do?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
Git out of here, <i>umbre</i>&ndash;&ndash;go on now! Never mind,
Jasp, I&#8217;ll do the talkin&#8217;. You go on away, will ye!
Now what&#8217;s the matter with you, Mr. Creede, and
what can I do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jasper Swope had whirled back from the blow as
a rattler throws his coils. His gray eyes gleamed
and he showed all his broken teeth as he spat back
hate and defiance at Creede; but Jim was his elder
brother and had bested him more than once since
the days of their boyish quarrels. Slowly and
grudgingly he made way, backing sullenly off with
his Mexicans; and Jim stood alone, opposing his
cold resolution to the white-hot wrath of Creede.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can turn back them sheep and git off my
range!&#8221; yelled Creede. &#8220;Turn &#8217;em back, I say, or
I&#8217;ll leave my mark on some of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I turn &#8217;em back?&#8221; argued Swope, throwing
out his hands. &#8220;They&#8217;s ninety thousand more
behind me, and all headin&#8217; through this pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know very well that this is a put-up job,&#8221;
retorted Creede hotly. &#8220;You sheepmen have been
crawlin&#8217; around on your bellies for a month to get
a chanst to sheep us out, and now you say you can&#8217;t
help yourself! You&#8217;re the crookedest, lyingest
sheep-puller in the bunch, Jim Swope. You&#8217;d rob
a graveyard and show up for prayers the next
mornin&#8217;. I can lick you, you big Mormon-faced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
stiff, with one hand tied behind me, and what&#8217;s
more&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here now&ndash;&ndash;here no-ow&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; protested Swope,
holding out his hand for peace, &#8220;they ain&#8217;t no call
for no such talk. Mebbe you can lick me, and mebbe
you can&#8217;t, but it won&#8217;t do you any good to try. My
sheep is here, and here they&#8217;ll stay, until I git good
and ready to move &#8217;em. This is a free range and a
free country, and the man ain&#8217;t born that can make
me stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, and fixed his keen eyes upon Creede,
searching him to the heart; and before that cold, remorseless
gaze the fighting frenzy in his brain died
away. Meanwhile Hardy had come up from where
he had been turning back sheep, and as he rode in
Jeff instinctively made way for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Hardy, fastening his stern eyes upon
the iron visage of the sheepman, &#8220;not if the lives of
a thousand cattle and the last possessions of a dozen
men lay in your way. You and your legal rights!
It is men like you who make the law worse than
nothing and turn honest cowmen into criminals. If
there is anything in it you will lie to the assessor or
rob a poor man&#8217;s cabin with the best of them, but
when it comes to your legal right to sheep us out you
are all for law and order. Sure, you will uphold
the statutes with your life! Look at those renegade
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
Mexicans, every man armed by you with a rifle and
a revolver! Is that the way to come onto another
man&#8217;s range? If you are going to sheep us out, you
can try it on; but for God&#8217;s sake cut it out about
your sacred rights!&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose up in his saddle, haranguing the assembly
as he spoke, and once more Jim Swope felt his cause
being weakened by the attacks of this vehement little
cowman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what kin I do about it?&#8221; he cried, throwing
out his hands in virtuous appeal. &#8220;My sheep has got
to eat, hain&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; assented Hardy, &#8220;and so have our cattle.
But I tell you what you can do&ndash;&ndash;you can go out
through that pass yonder!&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed at the ca&ntilde;on down which the sheep had
come in the Fall, the great middle fork which led
up over the Four Peaks; but the sheepman&#8217;s only
reply was a snarl of refusal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if I know myself,&#8221; he muttered spitefully.
&#8220;How&#8217;d do, Judge!&#8221; He fixed his eyes eagerly
upon Judge Ware, who was hastening to join in
the struggle. &#8220;You&#8217;re just the man I want to
see,&#8221; he continued, advancing briskly to meet him,
&#8220;and I want to ask you, here and now before these
witnesses, do you claim any right to the exclusive use
of this land?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why, certainly not, certainly not,&#8221; answered the
judge warmly, &#8220;but at the same time I do claim an
equity which rises from prior and undisputed possession,
and which has always and ought now to protect
my range from any outside invasion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely, very likely,&#8221; remarked Swope dryly.
&#8220;And now, Judge, I want to ask you another question
before these witnesses. Did you or did you not
authorize your superintendent and foreman to
threaten and intimidate my men and me, with the
idea of driving us off this public land?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not,&#8221; replied the judge, his mind suddenly
filled with visions of criminal proceedings. &#8220;On the
contrary, I have repeatedly warned them against any
such action.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time,&#8221; echoed Swope, quick to follow
up his advantage, &#8220;these men, who are your agents
and employees, have systematically moved my herders
off this range by armed violence, and your foreman
has just now struck my brother, besides
threatening to kill some of us if we don&#8217;t turn back.
I want to tell you right now, Mr. Ware, that I have
consulted the best lawyers in this Territory as to
my rights on public lands, and you will be held personally
responsible for any acts of violence on the
part of your employees. Now I want to ask you
one more question: Do you deny my right to pass
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
through this range on my way to the Sierra Blancas?
You don&#8217;t? Well then, call off these men!&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and jerked his thumb toward Creede
and Hardy, grinning evilly, and as he spoke Creede
crowded forward, his brow black as a thunder cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t take orders from nobody,&#8221; he cried vehemently,
&#8220;not now, and never will. I&#8217;ve got a few
hundred head of cows on this range myself and I
intend to protect &#8217;em if I have to kill somebody.
You&#8217;ll have to git another foreman, Judge,&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve
quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shot a glance of pitying contempt at the man
who had so stupidly marred their fortunes, then
he turned and fixed his burning eyes upon his archenemy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; he said, speaking quietly at last, &#8220;my
father had ten thousand head of cattle on this range
before you sheepmen came&ndash;&ndash;and that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got
left. If you think you can sheep me out, go to it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned his horse&#8217;s head toward Hidden Water,
never looking back at the sheep; and the cowmen
fell in behind him, glad of an excuse to retreat.
What were a bunch of cowboys, armed with six-shooters,
to half a hundred sheepmen armed with
repeating rifles and automatic revolvers? No, it was
better to let the sheep come, let them spread out and
scatter, and then jump the herders at night, if it came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
to that. But what, reasoned the cautious ones, were
a few hundred head of cows anyhow, in a losing fight
against the law itself? What was a petty revenge
upon some low-browed Mexican to the years of imprisonment
in Yuma which might follow? There
were some among that little band of cowmen who
yelled for action, others who were disgusted enough
to quit, and others yet who said nothing, riding
by themselves or exchanging furtive glances with
Creede. The Clark boys, Ben Reavis, and Juan
Ortega&ndash;&ndash;these were the men whom the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> boss
knew he could trust, and none of them spoke a word.</p>
<p>Worn and haggard from his night&#8217;s riding, Rufus
Hardy rode along with Judge Ware and the ladies,
explaining the situation to them. The sheep had
come in from the far east, crossing where sheep had
never crossed before, at the junction of Hell&#8217;s Hip
Pocket Creek and the drought-shrunk Salagua.
They had poured into the Pocket in solid columns,
sheeping it to the rocks, and had taken the pass before
either he or Bill Johnson could get to it. All through
the night the sheepmen had been crowding their
flocks through the defile until there were already
twenty or thirty thousand on Bronco Mesa, with
fifty thousand to follow. Bill Johnson had shot his
way through the jam and disappeared into the
Pocket, but he could do nothing now&ndash;&ndash;his little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
valley was ruined. There would not be a spear of
grass left for his cattle, and his burros had already
come out with the pack animals of the sheepmen. No
one knew what had happened when he reached his
home, but the Mexican herders seemed to be badly
scared, and Johnson had probably tried to drive them
out of the valley.</p>
<p>All this Hardy explained in a perfectly matter-of-fact
way, free from apprehension or excitement; he
listened in respectful silence to Judge Ware&#8217;s protests
against violence and threats of instant departure;
and even humored Kitty&#8217;s curiosity by admitting that
Mr. Johnson, who was apparently out of his head
when he shot the sheep, had probably taken a shot
or two at the herders, as well. But Lucy Ware was
not deceived by his repose; she saw the cold light
in his eyes, the careful avoidance of any allusion to
his own actions, and the studied concealment of his
future intent. But even then she was not prepared
when, after supper, her father came into the ranch
house and told her that Mr. Hardy had just resigned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine why he should leave me at this
time,&#8221; exclaimed the judge, mopping the sweat from
his brow, and groaning with vexation, &#8220;but a man
who will desert his own father in the way he has
done is capable of anything, I suppose. Just because
he doesn&#8217;t approve of my policies in regard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
to these sheep he coolly says he won&#8217;t embarrass me
further by staying in my employ! I declare, Lucy,
I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m going to lose everything I have
down here if both he and Creede desert me. Don&#8217;t
you think you could persuade Rufus to stay? Go
out and see him and tell him I will consent to anything&ndash;&ndash;except
this <i>unlawful harrying</i> of the
sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old judge, still perspiring with excitement,
sank wearily down into a chair and Lucy came over
and sat upon his knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; she said, &#8220;do you remember that you
once told me you would give me this ranch if I
wanted it? Well, I want it now, and perhaps if you
give it to me Rufus will consent to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, daughter&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; protested the judge, and then
he sat quiet, pondering upon the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;But tell
me one thing&ndash;&ndash;there is nothing between you and
Rufus, is there?&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned her face so that he could look into her
honest eyes, but Lucy twisted her head away,
blushing.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said faintly. &#8220;He&ndash;&ndash;he is in love with
Kitty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Kitty!&#8221; cried Judge Ware, outraged at the
idea. &#8220;Why, he&ndash;&ndash;but never mind, never mind,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
darling. I am glad at least that it is not with you.
We must be going home soon now, anyway, and that
will break off this&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;But I don&#8217;t remember
having seen them together much!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Lucy demurely, &#8220;he has been very discreet.
But you haven&#8217;t answered my question,
father. Will you give me the ranch if I get Rufus
to stay? Oh, you&#8217;re a dear! Now you just leave
everything in my hands and see what a good business
woman I am!&#8221;</p>
<p>She skipped lightly out the door and hurried over
to where Hardy and Jefferson Creede were sitting
under a tree, talking gravely together. They
stopped as she approached and Hardy looked up a
little sullenly from where he sat. Then he rose, and
took off his hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I have a few words with you on a matter
of business, Rufus?&#8221; she asked, with her friendliest
smile. &#8220;No, don&#8217;t go, Mr. Creede; you are interested
in this, too. In fact,&#8221; she added mysteriously,
&#8220;I need your assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>A slow smile crept into the rough cowboy&#8217;s eyes
as he sat watching her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I do for you?&#8221; he inquired guardedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered Lucy, &#8220;the situation is like this&ndash;&ndash;and
I&#8217;m not trying to rope you in on anything,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
as you say, so you needn&#8217;t look suspicious. My
father has become so discouraged with the way things
are going that he has given the entire Dos S Ranch
to me&ndash;&ndash;if I can manage it. Now I know that you
both have quit because you don&#8217;t approve of my
father&#8217;s orders about the sheep. I don&#8217;t know what
your plans are but I want to get a new superintendent,
and that&#8217;s where I need your assistance, Mr.
Creede.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused long enough to bestow a confiding
smile upon the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> boss, and then hurried on to explain
her position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you understand how it is with father.
He has been a judge, and it wouldn&#8217;t do for a man
in his position to break the laws. But I want you
two men to tell me before you go just what you think
I ought to do to save my cattle, and you can say whatever
you please. Mr. Creede, if you were a woman
and owned the Dos S outfit, what would you do about
the sheep?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a minute Creede sat silent, surveying the little
lady from beneath his shaggy hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said judicially, &#8220;I think I&#8217;d do one
of two things: I&#8217;d either marry some nice kind
man whose judgment I could trust, and turn the job
over to him,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he glanced sideways at Hardy as he
spoke,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;or I&#8217;d hire some real mean, plug-ugly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
feller to wade in and clean &#8217;em out. Failin&#8217; in that,
I think I&#8217;d turn the whole outfit over to Rufe here
and go away and fergit about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added these last words with a frank directness
which left no doubt as to his own convictions in the
matter, and Lucy turned an inquiring eye upon
Hardy. He was busily engaged in pounding a hole
in the ground with a rock, and Lucy noted for the
first time a trace of silver in his hair. The setting
sun cast deep shadows in the set lines of his face
and when he finally looked up his eyes were bloodshot
and haggard.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use in talking to me about that job,&#8221;
he said morosely. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got tired of taking orders
from a man that doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s talking
about, and I want to use my own judgment for a
while. We won&#8217;t let anything happen to your cattle,
Miss Lucy, and I thank you very much, but I&#8217;m
afraid I can&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped, and bowed his head, hammering
moodily away at his hole in the rocky ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me a minute, Miss Ware,&#8221; said Creede,
rising to his feet as the silence became oppressive.
&#8220;Come over here, Rufe, I want to talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>They stood with their heads together, Jeff tapping
the little man on the chest with every word, and still
there was the same dogged resistance. &#8220;Well, come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
on and let&#8217;s find out,&#8221; protested Creede at last, impatiently
dragging him back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Ware,&#8221; he said politely, &#8220;what do you expect
of this here supe? I might want that job myself,
later on,&#8221; he observed importantly.</p>
<p>Lucy smiled at the bare-faced fraud and hastened
to abet it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect him to look after my cattle,&#8221; she responded
promptly, &#8220;and to protect my best interests
according to his own judgment. The only thing I
insist upon is that he leave his gun at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said Creede briefly. &#8220;And I needed
the job, too,&#8221; he added lugubriously. &#8220;How about
your foreman?&#8221; he inquired, as if snatching at a
straw. &#8220;Same thing, eh? Well, I&#8217;ll go you&ndash;&ndash;next
month.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed, shrugged his shoulders, and crowded
his big black sombrero down over his eyes until it
gave him a comical air of despair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luck&#8217;s gone,&#8221; he remarked, reaching parenthetically
for a cigarette paper. &#8220;See you later.&#8221; And,
with a last roguish twinkle at Miss Lucy, he slouched
off toward the fire.</p>
<p>His luck indeed had gone, but somewhere in that
giant carcass which harbored the vindictive hate of
an Apache, and the restless energy of a Texano,
there still lingered the exuberant joyousness of a boy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
the indomitable spirit of the pioneer, resigned to
any fate so long as there is a laugh in it. As he
drifted into the crowd Lucy&#8217;s heart went out to him;
he was so big and strong and manly in this, the final
eclipse of his waning fortunes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Creede is a noble kind of a man, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;
she said, turning to where Hardy was still standing.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down, Rufus, and let&#8217;s talk this over
for a minute. But before you decide anything, I
want you to get a good night&#8217;s sleep. You are a
free man now, you know, and if there&#8217;s any worrying
to be done it&#8217;s my funeral&ndash;&ndash;isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>If he heard her at all Hardy made no response
to the jest. He stood before her, swaying dizzily as
he groped about for his hat, which had fallen from
his hand. Then at last a faint smile broke through
the drawn lines in his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; he said, sinking down at her side,
and as he settled back against the tree his eyes closed
instantly, like a child whose bedtime has come.
&#8220;I&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m so dead tired I can&#8217;t talk straight,
Lucy&ndash;&ndash;to say nothing of think. But&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll take
care of you. We aren&#8217;t sheeped out yet. Only&ndash;&ndash;only
I can&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;I forget what I&#8217;m going to say.&#8221;
His head fell forward as he spoke, his hands hung
heavy, and he slipped slowly to the ground, fast
asleep.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></div>
<p>After two days and nights of turmoil and passion
his troubles were ended, suddenly; and as she raised
him up Lucy Ware bent down quickly under cover
of the dusk and kissed his rumpled hair.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE DEPARTURE</h3>
</div>
<p>The gentle hand of sleep, which held Hardy in
a grip that was akin to death, blotting out the
past and dispelling all remembrance of his sorrows,
failed utterly to abate the fighting spirit of Jefferson
Creede or sap the Spartan grimness of his purpose.
Worn by the destroying anger of the previous day,
thwarted and apparently defeated, he rose up at the
first glow of dawn and set about his preparations
with an unemotional directness which augured ill
for Jasper Swope. Before the sun was an hour high
he had the town herd on the trail for Bender, entrusted
to the care of Bill Lightfoot and several
others of whom he wanted to be rid. The camp was
dismantled, the packs were loaded upon the spare
horses, and the outfit was ready to start for Carrizo
Creek before breakfast was more than finished in
the ranch house. After a final survey to make sure
that nothing had been overlooked in the scuffle, the
<i>rod&eacute;o</i> boss waved his hand to the leaders; then, as
the train strung out up the ca&ntilde;on, he rode over to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
the house to say good-bye. The last farewell is a
formality often dispensed with in the Far West;
but in this case the boss had business to attend to,
and&ndash;&ndash;well, he had something to say to Kitty Bonnair,
too.</p>
<p>Very quietly, in order not to awaken his partner&ndash;&ndash;whom
he had picked up like a tired baby and stored
away in the darkened bunk-room the evening before&ndash;&ndash;Creede
opened the door of the living-room, greeted
his lady-love with a cheerful grin, and beckoned Miss
Lucy outside by a backward jerk of the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to disturb you, Miss Ware,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but
we&#8217;re movin&#8217; camp this mornin&#8217; and before I go I
want to tell you about them cattle I&#8217;m just sendin&#8217;
to town. If I didn&#8217;t have other business on hand
I&#8217;d go down with you gladly and sell &#8217;em for you,
but when you git to Bender you go to Chris Johansen,
the cattle buyer, and give him this list. You
won&#8217;t savvy what it is but Chris will, and you tell
him that if he don&#8217;t give you the best market price
for them cows he&#8217;ll have to&ndash;&ndash;lick&ndash;&ndash;me! This is
a dry year and feeders ain&#8217;t much nohow, but I don&#8217;t
want to see no friend of mine robbed. Well, so-long,
Miss Ware. Hope you have a good trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gripped her hand awkwardly, picked up his
bridle lash, and thrust one boot thoughtfully into
the stirrup. Then, as if suddenly cognizant of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
neglected duty, he snapped his foot out and threw
the lash back on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say good-bye to the judge,&#8221; he drawled,
&#8220;so&#8217;s to show they ain&#8217;t no hard feelin&#8217;. Your old
man don&#8217;t exactly fit in these parts,&#8221; he observed
apologetically, &#8220;but he means well, I reckon. You
can tell &#8217;im some time that I was kind of excited
when I quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>His farewell was a sober and dignified affair, after
the courtly school of the South&ndash;&ndash;no allusions to the
past, no references to the future, merely a gentlemanly
expression of regret that his guest&#8217;s visit
should have been so suddenly terminated. But when
he turned to Miss Kitty his masterful eyes began to
glow and waver and he shifted his feet uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kin I speak with you a minute outside?&#8221; he said
at last; and Kitty, still eager to read the heart of
Man, the Unfinished, followed after him, laughing
as he stooped to pass his high hat through the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on out by the corral,&#8221; he urged, confidently
leading the way. When they were concealed by the
corner of the fence he stopped and dropped his bridle
rein.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve had a pretty good time together down
here, hain&#8217;t we?&#8221; he observed, twisting the fringe of
his shaps and smiling at her from beneath his forelock.
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got but a minute&ndash;&ndash;and there&#8217;s some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
rough work ahead, I reckon&ndash;&ndash;but I jest wanted to&ndash;&ndash;well,
I wanted to give you this.&#8221; He dove down
into his overalls&#8217; pocket and brought up a nugget,
worn smooth by long milling around between his
spare change and his jackknife.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a chunk of gold I found over by Red
Butte one time,&#8221; he said, handing it over. &#8220;Thought
you might want to keep it for me, you know. But
say&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He crowded his hands into his pockets and
canted his head to one side, ogling her roguishly.</p>
<p>Kitty had never observed just such conduct before,
and she was curious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;what?&#8221; she inquired, tossing back her hair
tantalizingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I git nothin&#8217; to remember you by, little
girl?&#8221; he demanded, his voice vibrant with passion.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve been pretty good friends, you know. In
fact&ndash;&ndash;well, say, don&#8217;t I git jest one kiss?&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew her gently into his arms as he spoke,
waited a fraction of a second for her to resist, and
then kissed her, suddenly and with masterful violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;One more,&#8221; he pleaded insistently. &#8220;No? All
right then,&#8221; he said, swinging gracefully up on his
horse as she pushed him away. &#8220;I&#8217;ll always remember
that one, anyhow!&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaned forward and Bat Wings shot away up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
the ca&ntilde;on like a charger that sniffs the combat,
thundering out across the <i>parada</i> grounds, swinging
beneath the giant mesquite, and plunging down the
bank that led to the creek. And all the time his
rider sat with one hand on the cantle, his white teeth
flashing back a wistful smile.</p>
<p>Taken by surprise Kitty Bonnair stood staring
blankly after him, rubbing her cheek which burned
hot where he had kissed her. She would always remember
that kiss too, and all too late she remembered
to become indignant. But, no one being
about, she laughed low to herself and hurried back
to the house, her eyes downcast and pensive. She
had known many men and lovers in her time, but
never a one like Jeff Creede.</p>
<p>There was a sound of hasty packing in the Dos S
ranch house that morning, and the wagon drove
noisily up to the door. Rafael carried out the steamer
trunks and luggage, the snake-skins, the smoky opals,
the Indian baskets, the braided quirts, and all the
scattered plunder that the cowboys had given Kitty
and that she could not bear to leave behind. He
saddled up their horses, clattering recklessly into the
bunk-house where Hardy was sleeping in order to
get his blankets, and still, unmindful of noise or
preparation, or the friends who must say good-bye,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
he lay sprawled on the rough blankets, dead with
sleep.</p>
<p>Rafael kicked off the brake and started on his
weary journey around Red Butte to Moreno&#8217;s,
which would take him the rest of the day; Judge
Ware, possessed to get out of the country before he
became <i>particeps criminis</i> to some lawless outrage,
paced restlessly up and down the <i>ramada</i>, waiting
for the girls to get ready; and Kitty and Lucy,
glancing guiltily at each other, fidgeted around in
their rooms waiting for Rufus to wake up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready,&#8221; said Lucy at last, putting the final
touches to the room which he had given up to her.
&#8220;Are you, Kitty?&#8221;</p>
<p>Their eyes met in an uneasy stare, each wishing
the other would speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Kitty, &#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;shall we go without saying
good-bye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world are you girls waiting for?&#8221;
demanded the judge, thrusting his head impatiently
in at the door. &#8220;I declare, I begin to think there
is something in these jokes about Adam waiting for
Eve to get her hat on straight. Now please come
at once or we won&#8217;t get to Moreno&#8217;s in time for supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, father,&#8221; protested Lucy, &#8220;Kitty and I do not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
wish to leave without saying good-bye to Rufus.
Would you mind&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; exclaimed Judge Ware irritably, &#8220;if he
chooses to sleep all day&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, father!&#8221; burst out Lucy, almost tearfully, &#8220;he
was so tired&ndash;&ndash;he fell asleep as soon as he sat down,
and I never did get him to consent to be my superintendent!
Don&#8217;t you see&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, write him a note then,&#8221; directed the judge
brusquely, &#8220;and leave it on his desk. Now, Lucy
dear, really I&#8217;m getting so nervous I&#8217;m hardly accountable.
<i>Please</i> hurry. And, Kitty, please hurry,
too!&#8221;</p>
<p>Like two souls haled from the world without a
word of explanation or confession, Kitty and Lucy
both sat down under duress to pen a last appeal to
the little man who, despite his stern disregard, somehow
held a place in their hearts. Kitty could have
wept with vexation at the thought of not seeing him
again&ndash;&ndash;and after she had brought her mind to forgive
him, too! She wrote blindly, she knew not what,
whether it was accusation or entreaty, and sealed the
envelope with a bang of her tiny fist&ndash;&ndash;and even then
he did not awaken. Lucy wrote carefully, wrestling
to turn the implacable one from his purpose and yet
feeling that he would have his will. She sealed her
note and put it upon his desk hesitatingly; then, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
Kitty turned away, she dropped her handkerchief
beside it. It was a time-worn strategy, such as only
the innocent and guileless think of in their hour of
adversity. When she ran back to recover it Lucy
drew a dainty book from her bosom&ndash;&ndash;Mrs. Browning&#8217;s
&#8220;Sonnets from the Portuguese&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and placed
it across her note as if to save it from the wind, and
between two leaves she slipped the forget-me-nots
which he had given her at Hidden Water.</p>
<p>As the thud of horses&#8217; hoofs died away silence settled
down upon the Dos S ranch house, the sombre
silence of the desert, unbroken by the murmur of
women&#8217;s voices or the echo of merry laughter, and the
sleeping man stirred uneasily on his bed. An hour
passed, and then from the <i>ramada</i> there came a
sound of wailing. Hardy rose up on his bed suddenly,
startled. The memory of the past came to
him vaguely, like fragments of an eerie dream; then
the world came right and he found himself in the
bunk-house, alone&ndash;&ndash;and Tommy outside, crying as
if for the dead. Leaping up from his blankets
Hardy opened the door and called him in&ndash;&ndash;hoarse,
black, distorted, yet overflowing with love and affection.
Poor little Tommy! He took him in his arms
to comfort him, and bedded him down on the pillow.
But when he stepped outside he found that his world
too was vacant&ndash;&ndash;the house deserted, the corrals
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
empty, the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> camp a smouldering fireplace, surrounded
by a wilderness of tin cans.</p>
<p>As the slow grief of the forsaken came upon him
he turned and went to his room, where the atmosphere
of womankind still lingered to suggest the
dear hands that were gone, and suddenly his eyes
leaped to the letters left upon the table. It was
Kitty&#8217;s which he opened first, perhaps because it was
nearest; but the torrent of inconsequential words
confused him by their unreason and he turned to
Lucy&#8217;s, reading it over thoughtfully.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Dear Rufus</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have waited a long time for you to wake up, and now
father says we must go. You were so tired last night that
I doubt if you heard a word I said, although I thought I
was making a great impression in my new role as a business
woman. I asked father to give me the ranch, not because I
wanted to own it but to save you from your madness. The
cattle are all mine now and I leave them in your care. Whatever
you do I will consent to, if you will leave your guns at
home. Is that too much for a friend to ask? I know that
Mr. Creede is your friend too, and I admire your devotion
to his cause, but I think you can do just as much for him
and more by not risking your life in a battle against the sheep.
They are so many, Rufus, and they have their rights, too.
Father is confident that the Forest Reserve will be declared
next Winter and then the sheep will be debarred forever.
Can&#8217;t you give over the fight for my sake? And I will pay
you any price&ndash;&ndash;I will do anything you ask; but if you should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
be killed or kill some other man, I could never be happy again,
though I gained the whole world. Dear Rufus, please&ndash;&ndash;but
I leave it for you to decide&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The note ended abruptly, it was not even signed,
and Hardy could imagine the agitation in which it
was written. Dear little Lucy, always thinking of
others, always considerate, always honest and reasonable.
If only Kitty&ndash;&ndash;But no&ndash;&ndash;in her own right
as Queen of Love and of his heart, she was above all
criticism and blame. It was a madness, deeper than
his anger against the sheep, mightier than his fiercest
resentment&ndash;&ndash;he could not help it; he loved her.
Changeable, capricious, untamed, she held him by her
faults where virtues would hardly have sufficed in
another. He had tried, and failed; so long as she
was in the world he must love her. But what a life!
He cast the letter from him and his heart turned to
Jeff and the big fight, the battle that they had
planned to wage together. In the rush and struggle
of that combat he could forget the pangs which tortured
him; he could have his revenge on life, which had
treated him so shabbily! And yet&ndash;&ndash;and yet&ndash;&ndash;could
he desert a friend like Lucy&ndash;&ndash;Lucy who would give
her life to make him happier, who had always by
every act tried to make him forget his sorrows?</p>
<p>For a long time he sat with his head bowed, thinking.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
Then he rose up and took down his long-barrelled
Colt&#8217;s, fingered it lovingly, and thrust it,
scabbard and all, into the depths of his war bag.</p>
<p>As he rode down the hill into the camp that afternoon
Creede came out to meet him, and when his eyes
fell upon the empty belt, he smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you woke up, did you?&#8221; he inquired, laying
one hand carelessly on the bulge in Hardy&#8217;s right
shap, where modest cowboys sometimes secrete their
guns. &#8220;Um-huh!&#8221; he grunted, slapping the left
shap to make sure. &#8220;I suspected as much. Well,
I congratulate you, supe&ndash;&ndash;if my girl had asked me I
reckon I&#8217;d&#8217;ve give up my gun too. But she gimme
a kiss, anyway,&#8221; he added, tossing his head triumphantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who did?&#8221; demanded Hardy, coming suddenly
out of his dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Kitty, sure,&#8221; returned Creede artlessly;
and then, noting the look of incredulity on his partner&#8217;s
face, he slapped him on the leg and laughed consumedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re not the only pebble on the beach,&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;Ump-um&ndash;&ndash;there are others! Say, it&#8217;s
hell to be in love, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked up at Hardy, the laughter still in his
cheeks, but for once there was no answering smile.
The large gray eyes were far away and distant,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
fixed vacantly upon the dust cloud where the sheep
gathered in the east. Then, as if dismissing some
haunting vision from his mind, the little man shook
himself and drew away.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; he said solemnly, &#8220;it is.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>CHICO AND GRANDE</h3>
</div>
<p>Between the mouth of Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket and
the cow camp at Carrizo Creek there lie three
high ridges and three broad valleys, all running north
and south from the Peaks to Bronco Mesa&ndash;&ndash;the
heart of the upper range; and there in compact bands
the invaders held their sheep. From the lower levels
they strayed out gradually over the rocky mesa;
above they clambered up toward the wooded peaks;
but at night the sheepmen worked back to the three
ridges and camped close together for defence. After
many years of struggle they had at last obtained
their legal rights&ndash;&ndash;their sheep were up to the ears
in grama, eating out the heart of the cow country&ndash;&ndash;but
Jeff Creede was just over the hill, and the
Mexicans were afraid. For years now the huge
form of &#8220;Grande&#8221; had loomed before them whenever
they entered that forbidden range, and they had
always given way before him. And now he had the
little man Chico with him, the son of a soldier, so
it was said, and a gentleman of <i>categor&iacute;a</i>; he always
carried a pistol and his eyes were stern and hard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
What would not Chico and Grande do to them, now
that they were like bees robbed of their long-hoarded
honey, who have nothing left but their stings?</p>
<p>So the word passed around amongst the herders and
camp rustlers, and Jim and Jasp rode from one camp
to the other, cursing and exhorting and holding them
to their work. The hour of victory had come, but
their triumph was poisoned by a haunting fear for
their sheep. One hundred thousand sheep&ndash;&ndash;five
hundred thousand dollars&#8217; worth&ndash;&ndash;the accumulation
of a lifetime&ndash;&ndash;and all in the hands of these cowardly
Mexicans, not half of whom would fight! For the
day or two that they held together they were safe,
but when they spread out&ndash;&ndash;and spread they must,
to reach the western pass&ndash;&ndash;then the cowmen could
rush them at night like lions that raid a corral,
scattering one band after the other, and the coyotes
would do the rest! That was the joint in the armor
of the sheepmen, and it robbed them of their sleep.</p>
<p>Evening came, and the fires of the camp rustlers
on the ridges lit up the dust cloud that hung in the
east. The hateful bray of the sheep was hushed, at
last, and the shrill yell of the coyotes rose from every
hilltop, bidding farewell to the sun; for as vultures
and unnumbered birds of prey hovered in the wake
of barbarian armies, casting their dread shadows upon
the living and glutting upon the dead, so the coyotes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
follow tirelessly after the sheep, gorging upon chance
carcasses and pulling down the strays. As the wild,
gibbering chorus rose and quavered back from the
cliffs the cowmen at Carrizo glanced up from their
supper and swore, and in the general preoccupation
Hardy put down his plate and slipped away to the
corral. He was sitting on the fence listening to the
mad yelping of the coyotes and watching the shadows
gather among the peaks, when Creede strolled over
and joined him. There were times when he could
read Hardy like a book, but at others the little man&#8217;s
thoughts were hidden, and he brooded by himself.
On such occasions, after a sufficient interval, Jeff
esteemed it his duty to break in upon these unprofitable
ruminations and bring him back to the light. So
he clambered up on the top log and joined in the
contemplation of nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear them dam&#8217; coyotes,&#8221; he observed sociably.
&#8220;They&#8217;d cry that way if they&#8217;d had a chicken dinner,
all around. I bet ye every one of &#8217;em has got wool
in his teeth, right now. Never you mind, birdie,&#8221;
he continued, apostrophizing a peculiarly shrill-voiced
howler, &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a bellyful of mutton
pretty soon, if it&#8217;s the last act. What <i>you</i> going to
do now, Rufe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered Hardy, &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll try and
earn my salary by moving a few sheep. And of course
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
we want to gather every beef critter we can now,
while they&#8217;re fat. The sheep seem to be hugging the
mountain pretty close. What&#8217;s the matter with
working the Pocket Butte to-morrow and while the
boys are riding we&#8217;ll warn all the stragglers down
there to keep up against the hills; then as soon as we
get &#8217;em located we&#8217;ll jump in some day and move
&#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; inquired Creede, shoving back his hat and
staring. &#8220;Did I hear you say &#8216;move &#8217;em&#8217;? Well&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;I
thought you left your gun at home,&#8221; he suggested
guardedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; admitted Hardy, &#8220;but don&#8217;t you
let that worry you any. I told you I&#8217;d help move
those sheep, and I&#8217;ll do it! We don&#8217;t need guns,
anyhow. Why, I&#8217;d just as soon tackle a rattlesnake
bare-handed as go after Jasp Swope with my six-shooter.
That&#8217;s just what he&#8217;s looking for, boy,
with all those thirty-thirties behind him, and he&#8217;ll
have plenty of witnesses there to swear us into Yuma,
too. I tell you, Jeff, I&#8217;ve been thinking this over, and
I believe my boss is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Creede, showing his teeth in the
twilight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, let up on that, will you?&#8221; exclaimed Hardy
irritably. &#8220;I&#8217;m talking business. Now you let me
tell you something.&#8221; He paused, and fixed his eye
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
on the dust cloud, intently. &#8220;I&#8217;ve moved that many
sheep twice,&#8221; he said, throwing out his hand, &#8220;and
I left my gun at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; conceded Creede.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well now, I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do,&#8221; continued
Hardy. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll leave your gun at home too and
stay with me on this I&#8217;ll undertake to shoot the last
sheep out through West Pass inside of a week. And
the only chance we take is of getting shot at or arrested
for assault and battery. The Territorial
Prison end of this gun business never did appeal me,
anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;nor me either! But what&#8217;s the scheme?&#8221;</p>
<p>The big cowboy leaned forward eagerly, his eyes
flashing as he half guessed the plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ride out together,&#8221; said Hardy, his voice far
away, as if he saw it in his mind&#8217;s eye, &#8220;unarmed&ndash;&ndash;and
we notify every sheep-herder we see to move.
If Jasp Swope or any of his men kill us while we&#8217;re
unarmed it&#8217;ll be cold-blooded murder, and there&#8217;ll
be witnesses to prove it. And if the sheep don&#8217;t
move, <i>we&#8217;ll move &#8217;em</i>! What kind of a crime is
that, anyway&ndash;&ndash;to drive sheep off the public range?
There isn&#8217;t an officer of the law within sixty miles,
anyhow; and if anybody pulls a gun on us we can
slug him in self-defence.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; agreed Creede, &#8220;but suppose one of them
big-headed Chihuahua Mexicans should happen to
shoot you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, I&#8217;d be dead,&#8221; said Hardy soberly.
&#8220;But wouldn&#8217;t you rather be dead than shut up in
that hell-hole down at Yuma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; cried Creede, holding out his hands as if
taking an oath. &#8220;I would, by God!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, come on then!&#8221; said Hardy, and they shook
hands on it like brothers.</p>
<p>When the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> outfit was gathered together in
the morning Jefferson Creede deliberately unstrapped
his cartridge belt and threw his pistol back
onto his bed. Then he winked at his partner as if,
rightly understood, the action was in the nature of a
joke, and led the way to Pocket Butte.</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellows rake the ridges to Bullpit Valley,&#8221;
he said, briefly assigning every man to his post.
&#8220;Rufe &#8217;n me&#8217;ll hold &#8217;em up for you about four
o&#8217;clock, but don&#8217;t rush the funeral&ndash;&ndash;we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to
move a few sheep first.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled mysteriously as he spoke, staving off
their pointed queries with equivocal answers.</p>
<p>&#8220;See you later,&#8221; he observed, turning his horse into
a sheep trail, and with that the outfit was forced to
be content.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span></div>
<p>The offending sheep were found feeding along the
eastern slope of a long ridge that led down from the
upper ground, and the herders were camped on
the summit. There were four men gathered about the
fire and as the cowboys approached three of them
picked up their carbines and sat off to one side, fingering
the locks nervously. The appearance of Jeff
Creede spelled trouble to all sheepmen and there were
few camps on Bronco Mesa which did not contain a
herder who had been unceremoniously moved by him.
But this time the fire-eating cowman rode grandly
into camp without any awe-inspiring demonstrations
whatever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are those your sheep?&#8221; he inquired, pointing to
the grazing herd.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>S&iacute; se&ntilde;or</i>,&#8221; responded the boss herder humbly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Creede, &#8220;move &#8217;em, and move
&#8217;em quick. I give you three days to get through
that pass.&#8221; He stretched a heavily muscled arm
very straight toward the notch in the western hills
and turned abruptly away. Hardy swung soberly
in behind him and the frightened Chihuahuanos were
beginning to breathe again after their excitement
when suddenly Jeff stopped his horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he said, turning to the boss, &#8220;what you
carryin&#8217; that cow&#8217;s horn for?&#8221;</p>
<p>At this pointed inquiry the boss herder flinched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
and looked downcast, toying uneasily with the
primitive instrument at his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;To blow,&#8221; he answered evasively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, go ahead and blow it, then,&#8221; suggested
Creede amiably. &#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;go on! <i>I</i> don&#8217;t care what
happens. Aw here, let me have it a minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>He grabbed the horn away impatiently, wiped
the mouthpiece with his sleeve, drew a long breath,
and blew. A deep bass roar answered to his effort,
a bellow such as the skin-clad hunters of antiquity
sent forth when they wound the horn for their
hounds, and the hills and valleys of Carrizo and the
upper mesa echoed to the blast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that&#8217;s great!&#8221; exclaimed the big cowboy,
good-naturedly resisting the appeals of the herder.
&#8220;I used to have one like that when I was a boy. Oh,
I&#8217;m a blower, all right&ndash;&ndash;listen to this, now!&#8221; He
puffed out his chest, screwed his lips into the horn,
and blew again, loud and long.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that for high?&#8221; he inquired, glancing
roguishly at his partner. &#8220;And I could keep it up
all day,&#8221; he added, handing the horn back, &#8220;only
I&#8217;ve got business elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Oyez, amigo</i>,&#8221; he said, bending his brow suddenly
upon the Mexican herder, &#8220;remember, now&ndash;&ndash;in
three days!&#8221; He continued the sentence by a
comprehensive sweep of the hand from that spot out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
through the western pass, favored each of the three
Chihuahuanos with an abhorrent scowl, and rode
slowly away down the hogback.</p>
<p>&#8220;Notice anything funny over on that ridge?&#8221; he
asked, jerking his head casually toward the east.
&#8220;That&#8217;s Swope and Co.&ndash;&ndash;the Sheepmen&#8217;s Protective
Association&ndash;&ndash;coming over to rescue <i>companero</i>.&#8221;
A line of rapidly moving specks proved
the truth of his observation, and Creede&#8217;s shoulders
shook with laughter as he noted their killing pace.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tumbled to the idee the minute I set eyes on that
cow&#8217;s horn,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like this. Every boss
herder has a horn; if he gits into trouble he blows
it and all hands come a-runnin&#8217; to shoot holes in Mr.
Cowman&ndash;&ndash;think I&#8217;ll make one myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He halted behind a rock and scrutinized the approaching
horsemen over the top.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Jasp, in front,&#8221; he observed impersonally.
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind ownin&#8217; that black mule of his&#8217;n,
neither. We&#8217;ll jest wait until they dip down into the
ca&ntilde;on and then double in back of him, and scare up
them <i>hombres</i> over at the mouth of Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket.
We want to git &#8217;em started out of that. I believe
you&#8217;re right, though, Rufe&ndash;&ndash;we can run this bunch
out without firin&#8217; a shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>That evening after the day&#8217;s riding Creede sat
down on his heels by the fire and heated the end of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
an iron rod. In his other hand he held a horn,
knocked from the bleaching skeleton of a steer that
had died by the water, and to its end where the tip
had been sawed off he applied the red-hot iron, burning
a hole through to the hollow centre.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; he said, turning to one of the Clark boys,
&#8220;do you want a little excitement to-morrow? Well
then, you take this old horn and go play hide &#8217;n&#8217; seek
with Jasp. Keep him chasin&#8217;, and while the rest of
the boys are gatherin&#8217; cattle Rufe and me will move
a few sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, say,&#8221; broke in Ben Reavis impatiently,
&#8220;where do us fellers come in on this play? I thought
there was goin&#8217; to be a few shap lessons and a little
night work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; responded the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> boss philosophically,
&#8220;any time you fellers want to go up against them
thirty-thirties you can do so. It&#8217;s your own funeral,
and I&#8217;ll promise to do the honors right. But I&#8217;m
a law-abidin&#8217; cuss myself. I&#8217;m all the law now,
ever since I talked with Jim Swope&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s the greatest
graft they is.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, busily scraping his horn with a piece of
glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;s no doubt about it, fellers,&#8221; he said at last,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve been slow in the head. It&#8217;s a wonder we
ain&#8217;t all of us makin&#8217; hat bands in Yuma, by this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
time. I used to think that if you didn&#8217;t like a
sheepman&#8217;s looks the way to do was to wade in and
work him over a little; but that&#8217;s a misdemeanor, and
it don&#8217;t go now. It took as good a man as Rufe,
here, to put me wise; but I leave my gun in camp
after this. I&#8217;ve got them Greasers buffaloed, anyhow,
and Jasp knows if he plugs me when I&#8217;m unarmed
it&#8217;ll be a sure shot for the pen. The time may
come when guns is necessary, but I move that every
man leave his six-shooter in his bed and we&#8217;ll go
after &#8217;em with our bare hands. What d&#8217; ye say, Ben?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ben Reavis rose up on one elbow, rolled his eyes
warily, and passed a jet of tobacco juice into the
hissing fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not f&#8217;r me,&#8221; he said, with profane emphasis.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ner f&#8217;r me, either,&#8221; chimed in Charley Clark.
&#8220;A man stays dead a long time in this dry climate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you fellers see how many of my steers you
can ketch, then,&#8221; said Creede, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll move them
sheep myself&ndash;&ndash;leastways, me and Rufe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; assented Reavis resignedly, &#8220;but you
want to hurry up. I saw a cloud o&#8217; dust halfway
to Hidden Water this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning as the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> outfit hustled out
to pick up what cattle they could before they were
scattered by the sheep, Jim Clark, tall, solemn-faced,
and angular, rode by devious ways toward the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
eastern shoulder of the Four Peaks, where a distant
clamor told of the great herds which mowed
the mountain slopes like a thousand sickles. Having
seen him well on his way Creede and Hardy galloped
down the ca&ntilde;on, switched off along the hillside and,
leaving their horses among the rocks, climbed up on
a rocky butte to spy out the land below. High
ridges and deep ca&ntilde;ons, running down from the
flanks of the Four Peaks, lay to the east and north
and west; and to the south they merged into the broad
expanse of Bronco Mesa.</p>
<p>There it lay, a wilderness of little hills and valleys,
flat-topped benches and sandy gulches threaded
minutely with winding trails and cow paths, green
with the illusion of drought-proof giant cactus and
vivid desert bushes, one vast preserve of browse and
grass from the Peaks to the gorge of the Salagua.
Here was the last battle-ground, the last stand of
the cowmen against the sheep, and then unless that
formless myth, &#8220;The Government,&#8221; which no man
had ever seen or known, stepped in, there would be
no more of the struggle; the green mesa would be
stripped of its evanescent glory and the sheep would
wander at will. But as long as there was still a
chance and the cows had young calves that would die,
there was nothing for it but to fight on, warily and
desperately, to the end.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span></div>
<p>As Jefferson Creede looked out across that noble
landscape which he had struggled so resolutely to save
and saw the dust clouds of the sheep drifting across
it, the tears came to his eyes and blinded his keen
vision. Here at last was the end of all his struggles
and all his dreams; another year, or two years, and
the mesa would be devastated utterly; his cows would
be hollow-flanked and gaunted; his calves would totter
and die, their tender lips pierced with the spiny
cactus upon which their hard-mouthed mothers
starved; and all that fair land which he knew and
loved so well would be lost to him forever. He raised
his hand to his eyes as if shading them from the sun,
and brushed the tears away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, look at those sons o&#8217; guns hike,&#8221; he said,
baring his teeth venomously, &#8220;and every band headed
for Hidden Water! Go it, you tarriers&ndash;&ndash;and if
you can&#8217;t stop to eat the grass, tromple on it! But
wait, and if I don&#8217;t push in some Greaser&#8217;s face
to-day it&#8217;ll be because every one of them bands is
headin&#8217; for the western pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>He clambered slowly down from his perch and
swung up into the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talkin&#8217; never did do much good with a sheep-herder,&#8221;
he observed wisely. &#8220;As the old judge used
to say, &#8216;you&#8217;ve got to appeal to his better nature&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;with
a club.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></div>
<p>The most southerly of the seven bands was strung
out in marching order, the goats in front, the
hungriest sheep in the lead; and on both flanks and far
behind, the groups and clusters of feeders, pushing
out into the grassy flats and rearing up against the
trees and bushes. Without a word to the herders
Creede and Hardy took down their ropes and,
swinging the <i>hondas</i> upon the goats, turned the
advance guard northwest. The main herd and the drag
followed, and then the herders, all in a bunch for
courage.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the last time I talk to you,&#8221; said Creede,
his voice stifled with anger. &#8220;Turn to the north,
now, and keep a-goin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put spurs to his horse and rode west to the
second herd, and by noon they had turned all seven
toward the western pass. Every herder had his
cow&#8217;s horn and some of them were blowing continually,
but no one answered, and a messenger was sent
east for aid. They camped for the heat of the day,
making smoke upon the ridges, but no help came.
As the sun sank low and the curly-necked Merinos
rose up from their huddle and began to drift the
Mexicans turned them perforce to the north, looking back
sulkily toward the mouth of Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket where
other smokes rose against the sky. Until the sun set
they travelled, making their three miles and more,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
and not until they had corralled their flocks for the
night did Chico and Grande, the little and big
terrors of the sheep, give way from their strenuous
labors.</p>
<p>It was two hours after dark when they rode wearily
into the camp at Carrizo Creek. The fire was dying
down to embers and the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> outfit, worn out, had
turned in, some in the tin house, others outside, under
the brush <i>ramada</i> to escape the dew. No one moved
as they approached but Creede did not scruple to
wake up Jim Clark in order to learn the news.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d the old horn work?&#8221; he inquired cheerily.</p>
<p>&#8220;No good,&#8221; grunted Clark, rolling over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, go on, wouldn&#8217;t they chase ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope. Nothin&#8217; doin&#8217;. Say, lemme sleep, will
ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Creede, &#8220;when I git through with you.
Which way was them sheep travellin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, some was goin&#8217; straight up over the Four
Peaks and the rest was p&#8217;intin&#8217; west. You and your
old horn&ndash;&ndash;I nigh blowed my fool head off and never
got a rise! They was all blowin&#8217; them horns over by
the Pocket this aft.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um,&#8221; said Creede, &#8220;they was <i>all</i> blowin&#8217;, hey?
And what else was they doin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shootin&#8217;, fer further orders, and driftin&#8217; their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
sheep. They&#8217;s about a hundred thousand, right over
the hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; grunted Creede, turning to his belated dinner,
&#8220;what d&#8217;ye make of that, Rufe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; replied Hardy, &#8220;except more work.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed as if he had hardly fallen asleep when
Creede was up again, hurling the wood on the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pile out, fellers!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;You can sleep
all day bimebye. Come on, Rufe&ndash;&ndash;d&#8217;ye want to
find them sheep in the corral when you go back to
Hidden Water?&#8221; And so with relentless energy he
roused them up, divided out the work, and was off
again for Bronco Mesa.</p>
<p>It was early when they arrived at the first deserted
sheep camp, but search as they would they could
see no signs of the sheep. The puny fire over which
the herders had fried their bread and mutton was
wind-blown and cold, the burros and camp rustlers
were gone, and there was no guiding dust cloud against
the sky. From the little butte where Creede and
Hardy stood the lower mesa stretched away before
them like a rocky, cactus-covered plain, the countless
ravines and gulches hidden by the dead level of the
benches, and all empty, lifeless, void. They rode for
the second camp, farther to the west, and it too was
deserted, the sheep tracks cunningly milled in order
to hide the trail.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></div>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re gittin&#8217; foxy,&#8221; commented Creede, circling
wide to catch the trend of their departure, &#8220;but
I bet you money no bunch of Chihuahua Greasers
can hide twenty thousand sheep in my back yard
and me not know it. And I&#8217;ll bet you further that
I can find every one of them sheep and have &#8217;em
movin&#8217; before twelve o&#8217;clock, noon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having crystallized his convictions into this sporting
proposition the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> boss left the wilderness of
tracks and headed due south, riding fast until he was
clear of sheep signs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now here&#8217;s where I cut all seven trails,&#8221; he remarked
to his partner. &#8220;I happen to know where this
sheep outfit is headin&#8217; for.&#8221; With which enigmatic
remark he jerked a thumb toward Hidden Water and
circled to the west and north. Not half an hour later
he picked up a fresh trail, a broad path stamped
hard by thousands of feet, and spurring recklessly
along it until he sighted the herd he plunged helter-skelter
into their midst, where they were packed like
sardines in the broad pocket of a dry wash.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey there! <i>Whoopee&ndash;&ndash;hep&ndash;&ndash;hep!</i>&#8221; he yelled,
ploughing his way into the pack; and Hardy swinging
quickly around the flank, rushed the ruck of them
forward in his wake. Upon the brow of the hill
the boss herder and his helpers brandished their carbines
and shouted, but their words were drowned in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
the blare and bray which rose from below. Shoot
they dared not, for it meant the beginning of a
bloody feud, and their warnings were unheeded in
the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>. The herd was far up the wash and galloping
wildly toward the north before the frantic
Mexicans could catch up with it on foot, and even
then they could do nothing but run along the wings
to save themselves from a &#8220;cut.&#8221; More than once,
in the night-time, the outraged cowmen of the Four
Peaks country had thus dashed through their bands,
scattering them to the wolves and the coyotes, destroying
a year&#8217;s increase in a night, while the herders,
with visions of shap lessons before them, fired
perfunctory rifle shots at the moon. It was a form
of reprisal that they liked least of all, for it meant a
cut, and a cut meant sheep wandering aimlessly without
a master until they became coyote bait&ndash;&ndash;at the
rate of five dollars a head.</p>
<p>The <i>padron</i> was a kind man and called them <i>compadres</i>,
when he was pleased, but if one of them suffered
a cut he cursed, and fired him, and made him
walk back to town. Hence when Chico and Grande
suddenly gave over their drive and rode away to the
northwest the Mexican herders devoted all their attention
to keeping the herd together, without trying
to make any gun plays. And when the stampede
was abated and still no help came they drifted their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
sheep steadily to the north, leaving the camp rustlers
to bring up the impedimenta as best they could.
Jasper Swope had promised to protect them whenever
they blew their horns, but it was two days since they
had seen him, and the two <i>Americanos</i> had harried
them like hawks.</p>
<p>Never had armed men so lacked a leader as on that
day. Their orders were to shoot only in self-defence;
for a war was the last thing which the Swope
brothers wanted, with their entire fortunes at stake,
and no show of weapons could daunt the ruthless
Grande and Chico. All the morning the cow horns
bellowed and blared as, sweating and swinging their
<i>hondas</i>, the stern-eyed <i>Americanos</i> rushed band after
band away. Not a word was passed&ndash;&ndash;no threats,
no commands, no warnings for the future, but like
avenging devils they galloped from one herd to the
other and back again, shoving them forward relentlessly,
even in the heat of noon. At evening
the seven bands, hopelessly mixed and mingled in the
panic, were halfway through the long pass, and
the herders were white with dust and running. But
not until dusk gathered in the valleys did Creede rein
in his lathered horse and turn grimly back to camp.</p>
<p>His face was white and caked with dust, the dirt
lay clotted in his beard, and only the whites of
his eyes, rolling and sanguinary, gave evidence of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
humanity; his shirt, half torn from his body by plunging
through the cat-claws, hung limp and heavy with
sweat; and the look of him was that of a madman,
beside himself with rage. The dirt, the sweat, the
grime, were as heavy on Hardy, and his eyes rolled
like a negro&#8217;s beneath the mask of dust, but weariness
had overcome his madness and he leaned forward
upon the horn. They glanced at each other indifferently
and then slumped down to endure the long ten
miles which lay between them and home. It had been
a stern fight and the excitement had lulled their
hunger, but now the old, slow pang gnawed at their
vitals and they rolled like drunkards in the saddle.</p>
<p>It was a clear, velvety night, and still, after the
wind of the day. Their horses jogged dumbly along,
throwing up their heads at every step from weariness,
and the noises of the night fell dully upon their
jaded ears. But just as they turned into Carrizo
Creek Ca&ntilde;on, Creede suddenly reined in old Bat
Wings and held up his hand to Hardy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear that?&#8221; he asked, still listening.
&#8220;There! Didn&#8217;t you hear that gun go off? Well,
I did&ndash;&ndash;and it was a thirty-thirty, too, over there
toward the Pocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those herders are always shooting away their ammunition,&#8221;
said Hardy peevishly. &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s
get back to camp.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span></div>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t shoot in the night-time, though,&#8221; grumbled
Creede, leading off again. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet ye some
of them Greasers has seen a ghost. Say,&#8221; he cried,
&#8220;the boys may be out doin&#8217; some night ridin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>But when they rode into camp every man was in
his blankets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s all that shootin&#8217; goin&#8217; on over there?&#8221;
he called, waking up the entire outfit in his excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheepmen,&#8221; responded some sleeper briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cleanin&#8217; their guns, mebbe,&#8221; suggested another,
yawning. &#8220;Did you move &#8217;em, Jeff?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You betcher neck!&#8221; replied Creede promptly,
&#8220;and I&#8217;m goin&#8217; back in the mornin&#8217;, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The morning turned black, and flushed rosy, and
fell black again, but for once the merciless driver of
men slept on, for he was over-weary. It was a noise,
far away, plaintive, insistent, which finally brought
him to his feet&ndash;&ndash;the bleating of ewes to lambs, of
lambs to mothers, of wethers to their fellows, beautiful
in itself as the great elemental sounds of the
earth, the abysmal roarings of winds and waves and
waterfalls, but to the cowman hateful as the clamors
of hell. As Creede stood in his blankets, the salt
sweat of yesterday still in his eyes, and that accursed
blat in his ears, his nerves gave way suddenly, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
began to rave. As the discordant babel drew nearer
and nearer his passion rose up like a storm that has
been long brewing, his eyes burned, his dirty face
turned ghastly. Grabbing up his six-shooter he stood
like a prophet of destruction calling down the wrath
of God Himself, if there was a God, upon the head
of every sheepman. But even as he cursed the
first dirty brown wave spewed in over the ridge and
swept down upon their valley. Then in a moment
his madness overcame him and, raising his heavy
pistol, he emptied it against them defiantly, while the
resounding cliffs took up his wrath and hurled it
back. A herder with his rifle leapt up on a distant
rock and looked toward their camp, and at the sight
the black anger of Jeff&#8217;s father came upon him, filling
him with the lust to kill.</p>
<p>He rushed into the house and came out with a high-power
rifle. &#8220;You <i>will</i> stand up there and laugh
at me, will you?&#8221; he said, deliberately raising the
sights. &#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He rested the rifle against one of the <i>ramada</i> posts,
and caught his breath to aim, while the cowmen regarded
him cynically, yet with a cold speculation in
their eyes. Hardy alone sprang forward to spoil
his aim, and for a minute they bandied words like
pistol shots as they struggled for the gun. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
with a last wailing curse, the big cowboy snapped
the cartridge out of his rifle and handed it over to
his partner.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;let the dastard live.
But if I ever git another chanst at Jasp Swope
I&#8217;ll kill him, if I swing for it! He&#8217;s the boy I&#8217;m
lookin&#8217; for, but you see how he dodges me? I&#8217;ve
been movin&#8217; his sheep for two days! He&#8217;s afraid
of me&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s afraid to come out and fight me like
a man! But I&#8217;ll git &#8217;im&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll git &#8217;im yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Hardy soothingly, &#8220;you can do
it, for all of me. But don&#8217;t go to shooting Mexicans
off of rocks as if they were turkey buzzards&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s
what gets people into the pen. Now, you just take
my advice for once and wash some of that dirt off
your face. You&#8217;re locoed, man&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re not a
human being&ndash;&ndash;and you won&#8217;t be until you wash up
and get your belly full.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half an hour later they sat down to breakfast,
the burly fighting animal and the man who had
taught him reason; and as they ate the fierce anger
of the cowboy passed away like mists before the
morning sun. He heaped his plate up high and
emptied it again, drinking coffee from his big cup,
and as if ashamed of his brutishness he began forthwith
to lay out a campaign of peace. With sheep
scurrying in every direction across the range in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
great drive that was now on it was no use to try to
gather cows. What they had they could day-herd
and the rest would have to wait. The thing to do
now was to protect the feed around the water, so
that the cattle would not have to travel so far in the
heat of summer. No objection being offered he
gave each man a watercourse to patrol, sending one
over into the Pocket to see what had happened to
Bill Johnson; and then, with his gun packed in his
bed, he started back with Hardy to watch over Hidden
Water.</p>
<p>The sun was well up as they topped the high ridge;
and the mesa, though ploughed through and through
by the trails of the hurrying sheep, still shimmered
in its deceptive green. Not for a month had there
been a cloud in the sky and the grass on the barren
places was already withering in the heat, yet in the
distance the greasewood and the <i>palo verdes</i> and
giant cactus blended into one mighty sheet of verdure.
Only on the ground where the feed should be
were there signs of the imminent drought; and where
the sheep had crossed the ground lay hard and baked
or scuffled into dust. In the presence of those swift
destroyers the dreaded <i>a&ntilde;o seco</i> had crept in upon
them unnoticed, but soon it would scourge the land
with heat and dust and failing waters, and cattle lowing
to be fed. And there before their eyes, clipping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
down the precious grass, tearing up the tender
plants, shearing away the browse, moved the sheep;
army after army, phalanx and cohort, drifting forward
irresistibly, each in its cloud of dust. For a
minute the two men sat gazing hopelessly; then
Creede leaned forward in his saddle and sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he observed philosophically, &#8220;they&#8217;re movin&#8217;,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode down the long slope and, mounting a
low roll, paused again apathetically to watch a band
of sheep below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; exclaimed Creede, his eyes beginning to
burn, &#8220;d&#8217;ye notice how them sheep are travellin&#8217;?
And look at them other bands back yonder! By
Joe!&#8221; he cried, rising in his stirrups, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got &#8217;em
goin&#8217;! Look at the dust out through the pass,
and clean to Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket. They&#8217;re hikin&#8217;,
boy, they&#8217;re hittin&#8217; it up for The Rolls! But what
in the world has struck &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood up straight in his saddle, swinging his
head from east to west, but no band of horsemen met
his eye. He looked again at the flock below him&ndash;&ndash;the
goats, forever in the lead, heading straight for
the western pass; the herders swinging their carbines
upon the drag&ndash;&ndash;and seemed to study upon the miracle.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Have you got any money to spare, Rufe?&#8221; he inquired
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; responded Hardy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Creede deliberately, &#8220;I&#8217;d like
to make you a sporting proposition. I&#8217;ll bet you
forty dollars to the price of a drink that old Bill
Johnson has been shootin&#8217; up their camps. Will you
go me? All right, and I&#8217;ll make you a little side
bet: I&#8217;ll bet you any money that Jim Swope has
lost some sheep!&#8221;</p>
<p>He spurred his horse recklessly down the hill,
grinning, and at the clatter of rocks the fearful
herders jumped forward and raised a great clamor
behind their sheep, whistling and clubbing their guns,
but the heart of the monster Grande was no longer
turned to wrath. He laughed and called out to
them, leaping his horse playfully over washouts and
waving his black hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Cuidado, hombres</i>,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;be careful&ndash;&ndash;do
not hurry&ndash;&ndash;look at the nice grass!&#8221; But despite
this friendly admonition the herders still yelled
and whistled at their sheep, jabbing them spitefully
with the sharp muzzles of their rifles until at last, all
riot and confusion, they fled away bleating into the
west.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>BAD BLOOD</h3>
</div>
<p>The sheep were on the run, drifting across
Bronco Mesa as if the devil was after them, and
Creede could hardly stay on his horse from laughing&ndash;&ndash;but
when he drew near to Hidden Water his face
changed. There was a fresh sheep trail in the ca&ntilde;on
and it led away from the ranch. He spurred forward
like the wind, his eyes upon the tracks, and
when he came in sight of the house he threw down
his hat and swore. Of all the God-forsaken places
in Arizona, the Dos S Ranch was the worst. The
earth lay bare and desolate before it; the woodpile
had disappeared; the bucket was thrown down the
well. Never had the flat, mud buildings seemed so
deserted or Tommy so tragic in his welcome. The
pasture gate was down and even that holy of holies,
the branding corral, stunk of sheep. Only the padlocked
house had been respected, and that perforce,
since nothing short of a sledgehammer could break its
welded chain.</p>
<p>Unfastening the battered door they entered the
living-room which once had been all light and laughter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
There lay the dishes all clean and orderly on
the table, the floors swept, the beds made, some
withered flowers on Hardy&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; grunted Creede, looking it over coldly,
&#8220;we&#8217;re on the bum, all right, all right, now. How
long since they went away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout a year,&#8221; replied Hardy, and his partner did
not contradict him.</p>
<p>They cooked a hasty meal and ate it, putting the
scraps in the frying-pan for Tommy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to it, Tom,&#8221; said Creede, smiling wistfully as
the cat lapped away at the grease. &#8220;He never could
git used to them skirts rustlin&#8217; round here, could he?&#8221;
And then there was a long silence.</p>
<p>Tommy sat up and washed his face contentedly,
peering about with intent yellow eyes and sniffing
at the countless odors with which his world was filled&ndash;&ndash;then
suddenly with a low whining growl he lashed
across the room like a tiger and leapt up into his cat
hole. This was a narrow tunnel, punched through
the adobe wall near the door and boxed in with a
projecting cribbing to keep out the snakes and
skunks. Through it when his protectors were away
he could escape the rush of pursuing coyotes, or
sally forth with equal ferocity when sheep dogs were
about. He peered out of his porthole for a moment,
warily, then his stump tail began to twitch, he worked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
his hind claws into the wood, and leapt. A yelp of
terror from the <i>ramada</i> heralded his success and
Creede ran like a boy to look.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s jumped one, by Joe!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;What did I tell ye&ndash;&ndash;that cat is a holy terror on
dogs!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dog in question&ndash;&ndash;a slinking, dispirited cur&ndash;&ndash;wagged
its tail apologetically from a distance, shaking
its bloody ears, while Tommy swelled and hissed
viciously at him from his stronghold. It was a
sheep dog, part collie, part shepherd, and the rest
plain yellow&ndash;&ndash;a friendly little dog, too, and hungry.
But the heart of Creede, ordinarily so tender, was
hardened by his disasters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git out of here!&#8221; he commanded roughly. &#8220;Git,
you yap, or I&#8217;ll burn you up with a bullet!</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what comes of leavin&#8217; your gun off,&#8221; he
grumbled, as he unbound his bed and grabbed up his
pistol. But as he stepped out into the open to shoot,
his barbarity was checked by a clatter of hoofs and,
looking up, he saw Jasper Swope on his big black
mule, ambling truculently in across the open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hyar!&#8221; he shouted, shaking his fist angrily, &#8220;don&#8217;t
you shoot my dog, you&ndash;&ndash;or I&#8217;ll be the death of ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; responded Creede, bristling
back at him. &#8220;Keep the blame pup away, then&ndash;&ndash;and
keep that other dog away, too, or my cat&#8217;ll eat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
&#8217;im up! Well, I notice you took the occasion to
come down and sheep me out,&#8221; he observed, as
Swope pulled up before the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>did</i> not,&#8221; retorted the sheepman promptly, but
grinning nevertheless at the damage, &#8220;but I see some
other feller has though, and saved me the trouble.&#8221;
He ran his eye approvingly over the devastated homestead;
and then, rising in his stirrups, he plunged
suddenly into his set speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve took a lot off&#8217;n you, Jeff Creede,&#8221; he
shouted, swinging his arms wildly, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve got a
bellyful of this night work! And I come down to
tell you that next time you shoot up one of my camps
there&#8217;ll be trouble!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never shot up your old camp,&#8221; growled Creede,
&#8220;nor any other camp. I&#8217;m dam&#8217; glad to hear that
somebody else did though,&#8221; he added vindictively,
&#8220;and I hope to God he fixed you good and proper.
Now what can I do for you, Mr. Swope?&#8221; he inquired,
thrusting out his chin. &#8220;I suppose you must
be hurryin&#8217; on, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; cried Swope, slapping his saddle horn vehemently.
&#8220;I come down here to git some satisfaction
out of you! My sheep has been killed and my men
has been intimidated on this here public range, and
I want to tell you right now, Mr. Creede, that this
funny business has got to stop!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t choke!&#8221; said the cowman, fingering
his gun coldly. &#8220;Go ahead and stop it, why don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, a set smile on his lips, and for a moment
their eyes met in the baleful glare which rival
wolves, the leaders of their packs, confer upon each
other. Then Hardy stepped out into the open,
holding up his hand for peace.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mistaken, Mr. Swope,&#8221; he said quietly.
&#8220;Jeff hasn&#8217;t shot up any camps&ndash;&ndash;he hasn&#8217;t even
packed a gun for the last three days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he hain&#8217;t, hey?&#8221; sneered the sheepman, showing
his jagged teeth. &#8220;He seems to have one now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You betcher neck I have,&#8221; cried Creede, flaring
up at the implication, &#8220;and if you&#8217;re lookin&#8217; for
trouble, Jasp Swope, you can open up any time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y what&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; protested
Swope righteously. &#8220;You must have somethin&#8217; on
your mind, the way you act.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then without waiting for a reply to this innuendo
he turned his attention to Hardy.</p>
<p>&#8220;He hain&#8217;t shot up any camps,&#8221; he repeated,
&#8220;ner packed a gun for three days, hey? Now here&#8217;s
where I prove you a liar, Mr. Smarty. I seen him
with my own eyes take six shots at one of my herders
this very mornin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>and you was there!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>He punctuated his speech by successive downward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
jabs of his grimy forefinger as if he were stabbing
his adversary to the heart, and Hardy turned faint
and sick with chagrin. Never had he hated a man
as he hated this great, overbearing brute before him&ndash;&ndash;this
man-beast, with his hairy chest and freckled
hands that clutched at him like an ape&#8217;s. Something
hidden, a demon primordial and violent, rose up in
him against this crude barbarian with his bristling
beard and gloating pig eyes, and he forgot everything
but his own rage at being trapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie!&#8221; he cried passionately; and then in his
anger he added a word which he had never used, a
word which goes deep under the skin and makes men
fight.</p>
<p>For a moment the sheepman sat staring, astounded
by his vehemence; but before he could move the sudden
silence was split by the yelp of a dog&ndash;&ndash;a wild,
gibbering yelp that made them jump and bristle like
hounds that are assailed from behind&ndash;&ndash;and, mingling
stridently with it, was the harsh snarl of a cat.
There was a swift scramble in the dust by the door,
an oath from the sheepman, and the yellow dog dashed
away again, with Tommy at his heels.</p>
<p>Creede was the first man to regain his nerve and,
seeing his pet triumphant, he let out a whoop of
derisive laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah-hah-hah!&#8221; he hollered, pointing with his pistol
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
hand, &#8220;look at that, will ye&ndash;&ndash;<i>look</i> at &#8217;im&ndash;&ndash;<i>yee-pah</i>&ndash;&ndash;go
after &#8217;im, Tommy&ndash;&ndash;we&#8217;ll show the&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The fighting blood of the sheepman sided in as
quickly with his dog.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill that dam&#8217; cat!&#8221; he yelled, swinging down
from his saddle, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t let up! Hey, Nip!
Sick &#8217;im!&#8221; He turned and motioned to his other
dog, which had been standing dumbly by, and instantly
he joined in the chase. &#8220;Sick &#8217;em, boy,
<i>sick &#8217;em</i>!&#8221; he bellowed, urging him on, and before
Creede could get his face straight the long, rangy
brindle had dashed up from behind and seized
Tommy by the back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git out o&#8217; that!&#8221; thundered the cowman; and
then, without waiting on words, he threw his gun
down on the dog and fired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&ndash;&ndash;none of that, now!&#8221; shouted Swope,
whipping out his own pistol, and as he leapt forward
he held it out before him like a sabre, pointed
straight for the cowman&#8217;s ribs. His intentions may
have been of the best, but Hardy did not wait to see.
The brindle dog let out a surprised yelp and dropped.
Before Creede could turn to meet his enemy his partner
leapt in between them and with a swift blow from
the shoulder, struck the sheepman to the ground.</p>
<p>It was a fearful blow, such as men deal in anger
without measuring their strength or the cost, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
it landed on his jaw. Creede had seen men slugged
before, in saloon rows and the rough fights that
take place around a town, but never had he seen a
single blow suffice&ndash;&ndash;the man&#8217;s head go back, his
knees weaken, and his whole body collapse as if he
had been shot. If he had been felled like a bull in
the shambles that goes down in spite of his great
strength, Jasper Swope could not have been more
completely stunned. He lay sprawling, his legs
turned under him, and the hand that grasped the
six-shooter relaxed slowly and tumbled it into the
dust.</p>
<p>For a minute the two partners stood staring at
each other, the one still planted firmly on his feet
like a boxer, the other with his smoking pistol in his
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Joe, boy,&#8221; said Creede slowly, &#8220;you was just
in time that trip.&#8221; He stepped forward and laid
the fallen man out on his back, passing his gun up
to Hardy as he did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if you killed him,&#8221; he muttered, feeling
Jasp&#8217;s bull neck; and then, as Hardy ran for
some water, he remembered Tommy. But there was
no Tommy&ndash;&ndash;only a little heap of fur lying very
still out in the open.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; he cried, and leaving the man he ran
out and knelt down beside it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Pussy!&#8221; he whispered, feeling hopelessly for his
heart; and then, gathering the forlorn little wisp of
fur in his arms, he hurried into the house without a
word.</p>
<p>He was still in hiding when Jasper Swope came
to and sat up, his hair drenched with water and
matted with dirt. Staring doubtfully at the set
face of Hardy he staggered to his feet; then the
memory of the fight came back to him and he glared
at him with a drunkard&#8217;s insolence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s my gun?&#8221; he demanded, suddenly
clapping his hand upon the empty holster.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of that for you,&#8221; answered Hardy
pointedly. &#8220;Now you pile onto that mule of yours
and pull your freight, will you?&#8221; He led the black
mule up close and boosted its master into the saddle,
but Swope was not content.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that dastard, Jeff Creede?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;Well, I wanter see him, that&#8217;s all. And
say, Mr. Smart Alec, I want that gun, too, see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you won&#8217;t get it,&#8221; said Hardy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will that,&#8221; declared Swope, &#8220;&#8217;nd I&#8217;ll git you,
too, Willie, before I git through with you. I&#8217;ve had
enough of this monkey business. Now gimme that
gun, I tell ye, or I&#8217;ll come back with more of &#8217;em and
take it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He raised his voice to a roar, muffled to a beast-like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
hoarseness by his swollen jaws, and the <i>ramada</i> reverberated
like a cavern as he bellowed out his challenge.
Then the door was snatched violently open and Jefferson
Creede stepped forth, looking black as hell
itself. In one hand he held the sheepman&#8217;s pistol
and in the other his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; he said, and striding forward he thrust
Swope&#8217;s gun into his hand. &#8220;It&#8217;s loaded, too,&#8221; he
added. &#8220;Now, you&ndash;&ndash;if you&#8217;ve got any shootin&#8217; to
do, go to it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He stepped back quickly and stood ready, his
masterful eyes bent upon his enemy in a scowl of
unquenchable hate. Once before they had faced each
other, waiting for that mysterious psychic prompting
without which neither man nor beast can begin
a fight, and Jim had stepped in between&ndash;&ndash;but Hardy
stood aside without a word. It was a show-down and,
bulldog fighter though he was, Jasper Swope weakened.
The anger of his enemy overcame his hostile
spirit without a blow, and he turned his pistol away.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all I wanted,&#8221; he said, shoving the gun
sullenly into its holster. &#8220;They&#8217;s two of you,
and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re afraid,&#8221; put in Creede promptly.
He stood gazing at the downcast sheepman, his lip
curling contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen a sheepman yet,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
would fight. You&#8217;ve listened to that blat until it&#8217;s
a part of ye; you&#8217;ve run with them Mexicans until
you&#8217;re kin to &#8217;em; you&#8217;re a coward, Jasp Swope,
and I always knowed it.&#8221; He paused again, his
eyes glowing with the hatred that had overmastered
his being. &#8220;My God,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if I could only git
you to fight to-day I&#8217;d give everything I&#8217;ve got
left!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheepman&#8217;s gaze was becoming furtive as he
watched them. He glanced sidewise, edging away
from the door; then, pricking his mule with his spurs,
he galloped madly away, ducking his head at every
jump as if he feared a shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at the cowardly dastard!&#8221; sneered Creede
bitterly. &#8220;D&#8217;ye know what he would do if that was
me? He&#8217;d shoot me in the back. Ah, God A&#8217;mighty,
and that dog of his got Tommy before I could pull
a gun! Rufe, I could kill every sheepman in the
Four Peaks for this&ndash;&ndash;every dam&#8217; one of &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;and
the first dog that comes in sight of this ranch will
stop a thirty-thirty.&#8221; He stopped and turned away,
cursing and muttering to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;God A&#8217;mighty,&#8221; he moaned, &#8220;I can&#8217;t keep
<i>nothin&#8217;</i>!&#8221; And stumbling back into the house he
slammed the door behind him.</p>
<p>A gloom settled down over the place, a gloom that
lasted for days. The cowboys came back from driving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
the town herd and, going up on the mesa, they
gathered a few head more. Then the heat set in
before its time and the work stopped short. For the
steer that is roped and busted in the hot weather dies
suddenly at the water; the flies buzz about the ears
of the new-marked calves and poison them, and the
mother cows grow gaunt and thin from overheating.
Not until the long Summer had passed could the riding
continue; the steers must be left to feed down
the sheeped-out range; the little calves must run for
sleepers until the fall <i>rod&eacute;o</i>. Sheep and the drought
had come together, and the round-up was a failure.
Likewise the cowmen were broke.</p>
<p>As they gathered about the fire on that last night
it was a silent company&ndash;&ndash;the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> boss the gloomiest
of them all. Not since the death of Tommy had
his eyes twinkled with the old mischief; he had no
bets to offer, no news to volunteer; a dull, sombre
abstraction lay upon him like a pall. Only when Bill
Lightfoot spoke did he look up, and then with a set
sneer, growing daily more saturnine. The world
was dark to Creede and Bill&#8217;s fresh remarks jarred
on him&ndash;&ndash;but Bill himself was happy. He was of the
kind that runs by opposites, taking their troubles
with hilarity under the impression that they are
philosophers. His pretext for this present happiness
was a professed interview with Kitty Bonnair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
on the evening that the town herd pulled into
Moreno&#8217;s. What had happened at this interview
was a secret, of course, but it made Bill happy; and
the more morose and ugly Jeff became about it the
more it pleased Lightfoot to be gay. He sat on a
box that night and sang <i>risqu&eacute;</i> ditties, his enormous
Colt&#8217;s revolver dangling bravely at his hip; and at
last, casting his weather eye upon Creede, he began
a certain song.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;Oh, my little girl, she lives in the town&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>And then he stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill,&#8221; said the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> boss feelingly, &#8220;you make
me tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lay down an&#8217; you&#8217;ll git rested, then,&#8221; suggested
Lightfoot.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;<i>A toodle link, a toodle link, a too-oodle a day.</i>&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lay you down in a minute, if you don&#8217;t shut
up,&#8221; remarked Creede, throwing away his cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hell you say,&#8221; commented Lightfoot airily.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;And last time I seen her she ast me to come down.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>At this raw bit of improvisation the boss rose
slowly to his feet and stalked away from temptation.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;And if anybody sees her you&#8217;ll know her by this sign,&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>chanted the cowboy, switching to an out-and-out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
bad one; and then, swaying his body on his cracker
box, he plunged unctuously into the chorus.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;<i>She&#8217;s got a dark and rolling eye, boys;<br />
She&#8217;s got a dark and rolling eye.</i>&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>He stopped there and leapt to his feet anxiously.
The mighty bulk of the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> boss came plunging
back at him through the darkness; his bruising fist
shot out and the frontier troubadour went sprawling
among the pack saddles.</p>
<p>It was the first time Creede had ever struck one of
his own kind,&ndash;&ndash;men with guns were considered
dangerous,&ndash;&ndash;but this time he laid on unmercifully.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had that comin&#8217; to you for quite a while,
Bill Lightfoot,&#8221; he said, striking Bill&#8217;s ineffectual
gun aside, &#8220;and more too. Now maybe you&#8217;ll keep
shut about &#8216;your girl&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned on his heel after administering this
rebuke and went to the house, leaving his enemy
prostrate in the dirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;The big, hulkin&#8217; brute,&#8221; blubbered Lightfoot, sitting
up and aggrievedly feeling of his front teeth,
&#8220;jumpin&#8217; on a little feller like me&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; he never
give me no warnin&#8217;, neither. You jest wait, I&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, shut up!&#8221; growled Old Man Reavis, whose
soul had long been harrowed by Lightfoot&#8217;s festive
ways. &#8220;He give you plenty of warnin&#8217;, if you&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
only listen. Some people have to swallow a few front
teeth before they kin learn anythin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what call did he have to jump on me
like that?&#8221; protested Lightfoot. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t doin&#8217;
nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, nothin&#8217; but singin&#8217; bawdy songs about his
girl,&#8221; sneered Reavis sarcastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;His girl, rats!&#8221; retorted the cowboy, vainglorious
even in defeat, &#8220;she&#8217;s my girl, if she&#8217;s anybody&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, about <i>your</i> girl then, you dirty brute!&#8221;
snarled the old man, suddenly assuming a high moral
plane for his utter annihilation. &#8220;You&#8217;re a disgrace
to the outfit, Bill Lightfoot,&#8221; he added, with
conviction. &#8220;I&#8217;m ashamed of ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; chimed in the Clark boys, whose
sensibilities had likewise been harassed; and with all
the world against him Bill Lightfoot retired in a huff
to his blankets. So the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> ended as it had begun,
in disaster, bickering, and bad blood, and no man
rightly knew from whence their misfortune came.
Perhaps the planets in their spheres had cast a malign
influence upon them, or maybe the bell mare had
cast a shoe. Anyhow they had started off the
wrong foot and, whatever the cause, the times were
certainly not auspicious for matters of importance,
love-making, or the bringing together of the estranged.
Let whatsoever high-priced astrologer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
cast his horoscope for good, Saturn was swinging
low above the earth and dealing especial misery to
the Four Peaks; and on top of it all the word came
that old Bill Johnson, after shooting up the sheep
camps, had gone crazy and taken to the hills.</p>
<p>For a week, Creede and Hardy dawdled about the
place, patching up the gates and fences and cursing
the very name of sheep. A spirit of unrest hovered
over the place, a brooding silence which spoke only
of Tommy and those who were gone, and the two
partners eyed each other furtively, each deep in his
own thoughts. At last when he could stand it no
longer Creede went over to the corner, and dug up
his money.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to town,&#8221; he said briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; responded Hardy; and then, after
meditating a while, he added: &#8220;I&#8217;ll send down some
letters by you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Late that evening, after he had written a long
letter to Lucy and a short one to his father, he sat
at the desk where he had found their letters, and his
thoughts turned back to Kitty. There lay the little
book which had held their letters, just as he had thrust
it aside. He picked it up, idly, and glanced at the
title-page: &#8220;Sonnets from the Portuguese.&#8221; How
dim and far away it all seemed now, this world of
the poets in which he had once lived and dreamed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
where sweetness and beauty were enshrined as twin
goddesses of light, and gentleness brooded over all
her children. What a world that had been, with its
graceful, smiling women, its refinements of thought
and speech, its aspirations and sympathies&ndash;&ndash;and
Kitty! He opened the book slowly, wondering from
whence it had come, and from the deckled leaves a
pressed forget-me-not fell into his hand. That was
all&ndash;&ndash;there was no mark, no word, no sign but this,
and as he gazed his numbed mind groped through
the past for a forget-me-not. Ah yes, he remembered!
But how far away it seemed now, the bright
morning when he had met his love on the mountain
peak and the flowers had fallen from her hair&ndash;&ndash;and
what an inferno of strife and turmoil had followed
since! He opened to the place where the imprint
of the dainty flower lay and read reverently:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;If thou must love me, let it be for nought<br />
Except for love&#8217;s sake only. Do not say<br />
&#8216;I love her for her smile&ndash;&ndash;her look&ndash;&ndash;her way<br />
Of speaking gently&ndash;&ndash;for a trick of thought<br />
That falls in well with mine, and certes brought<br />
A sense of pleasant ease on such a day&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<br />
For these things in themselves, Belov&eacute;d, may<br />
Be changed, or change for thee&ndash;&ndash;and love, so wrought,<br />
May be unwrought so. Neither love me for<br />
Thine own dear pity&#8217;s wiping my cheek dry&ndash;&ndash;<br />
A creature might forget to weep, who bore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span><br />
Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!<br />
But love me for love&#8217;s sake, that evermore<br />
Thou mayst love on, through love&#8217;s eternity.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The spell of the words laid hold upon as he read
and he turned page after page, following the cycle
of that other woman&#8217;s love&ndash;&ndash;a love which waited
for years to be claimed by the master hand, never
faltering to the end. Then impulsively he reached
for a fair sheet of paper to begin a letter to Kitty,
a letter which should breathe the old gentleness and
love, yet &#8220;for love&#8217;s sake only.&#8221; But while he sat
dreaming, thinking with what words to begin, his
partner lounged in, and Hardy put aside his pen
and waited, while the big man hung around and
fidgeted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be in town to-morrer,&#8221; he said,
drearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aha,&#8221; assented Hardy.</p>
<p>&#8220;What ye got there?&#8221; inquired Creede, after a long
silence. He picked up the book, griming the dainty
pages as he turned them with his rough fingers,
glancing at the headings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Um-huh,&#8221; he grunted, &#8220;&#8216;Sonnets from the Portegees,&#8217;
eh? I never thought them Dagos could
write&ndash;&ndash;what I&#8217;ve seen of &#8217;em was mostly drivin&#8217;
fish-wagons or swampin&#8217; around some slaughterhouse.
How does she go, now,&#8221; he continued, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
his schooling came back to him, &#8220;see if I can make
sense out of it.&#8221; He bent down and mumbled over
the first sonnet, spelling out the long words doubtfully.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;I thought once how The-o-crite-us had sung<br />

</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Well say, what&#8217;s he drivin&#8217; at, anyway?&#8221; demanded
the rugged cowboy. &#8220;Is that Dago talk,
or is he jest mixed in his mind? Perfectly clear, eh?
Well, maybe so, but I fail to see it. Wish I could
git aholt of some <i>good</i> po&#8217;try.&#8221; He paused, waiting
for Hardy to respond.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he said, at last, &#8220;do me a favor, will ye,
Rufe?&#8221;</p>
<p>The tone of his voice, now soft and diffident, startled
Hardy out of his dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why sure, Jeff,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no &#8216;ifs&#8217; and &#8216;ands&#8217; about it!&#8221; persisted Creede.
&#8220;A lucky feller like you with everythin&#8217; comin&#8217; his
way ought to be able to say &#8216;Yes&#8217; once in a while
without hangin&#8217; a pull-back on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; grunted Hardy suspiciously, &#8220;you better
tell me first what you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I want you to write me a letter,&#8221; blurted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
out Creede. &#8220;I can keep a tally book and order up
the grub from Bender; but, durn the luck, when it
comes to makin&#8217; love on paper I&#8217;d rather wrastle
a bear. Course you know who it is, and you savvy
how them things is done. Throw in a little po&#8217;try,
will you, and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;say, Rufe, for God&#8217;s sake,
help me out on this!&#8221;</p>
<p>He laid one hand appealingly upon his partner&#8217;s
shoulder, but the little man squirmed out from under
it impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; he asked doggedly. &#8220;Sallie Winship?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, say,&#8221; protested Creede, &#8220;don&#8217;t throw it into
a feller like that&ndash;&ndash;Sal went back on me years ago.
You know who I mean&ndash;&ndash;Kitty Bonnair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kitty Bonnair!&#8221; Hardy had known it, but he
had tried to keep her name unspoken. Battle as he
would he could not endure to hear it, even from Jeff.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to tell Miss Bonnair?&#8221; he inquired,
schooling his voice to a cold quietness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell her?&#8221; echoed Creede ecstatically. &#8220;W&#8217;y,
tell her I&#8217;m lonely as hell now she&#8217;s gone&ndash;&ndash;tell her&ndash;&ndash;well,
there&#8217;s where I bog down, but I&#8217;d trade my
best horse for another kiss like that one she give me,
and throw in the saddle for <i>pelon</i>. Now, say, Rufe,
don&#8217;t leave me in a hole like this. You&#8217;ve made
your winnin&#8217;, and here&#8217;s your nice long letter to Miss

Lucy. My hands are as stiff as a burnt rawhide
and I can&#8217;t think out them nice things to say; but I
love Kitty jest as much as you love Miss Lucy&ndash;&ndash;mebbe more&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and
I wanter tell her so!&#8221;</p>
<p>He ended abjectly, gazing with pleading eyes at
the stubborn face of his partner whose lips were
drawn tight.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&ndash;&ndash;every man has to&ndash;&ndash;no, I can&#8217;t do it, Jeff,&#8221;
he stammered, choking. &#8220;I&#8217;d&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d help you if I
could, Jeff&ndash;&ndash;but she&#8217;d know my style. Yes, that&#8217;s
it. If I&#8217;d write the letter she&#8217;d know it was from me&ndash;&ndash;women
are quick that way. I&#8217;m sorry, but that&#8217;s
the way it is&ndash;&ndash;every man has to fight out his own
battle, in love.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and fumbled with his papers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a good pen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and&ndash;&ndash;and here&#8217;s
the paper.&#8221; He shoved out the fair sheet upon
which he had intended to write and rose up dumbly
from the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to bed,&#8221; he said, and slipped quietly
out of the room. As he lay in his blankets he could
see the gleam of light from the barred window and
hear Jeff scraping his boots uneasily on the floor.
True indeed, his hands were like burnt rawhide from
gripping at ropes and irons, his clothes were greasy
and his boots smelled of the corral, and yet&ndash;&ndash;she
had given him a kiss! He tried to picture it in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
mind: Kitty smiling&ndash;&ndash;or startled, perhaps&ndash;&ndash;Jeff
masterful, triumphant, laughing. Ah God, it was
the same kiss she had offered him, and he had run
away!</p>
<p>In the morning, there was a division between
them, a barrier which could not be overcome. Creede
lingered by the door a minute, awkwardly, and then
rode away. Hardy scraped up the greasy dishes and
washed them moodily. Then the great silence settled
down upon Hidden Water and he sat alone in the
shadow of the <i>ramada</i>, gazing away at the barren
hills.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE BIG DRUNK</h3>
</div>
<p>The sun rose clear for the hundredth time over the
shoulder of the Four Peaks; it mounted higher,
glowing with a great light, and the smooth round tops
of the bowlders shone like half-buried skulls along
the creek-bed; it swung gloriously up to its zenith and
the earth palpitated with a panting heat. Summer
had come, and the long days when the lizards crawl
deep into their crevices and the cattle follow the
scanty shade of the box ca&ntilde;ons or gather in standing-places
where the wind draws over the ridges and
mitigates the flies. In the pasture at Hidden Water
the horses stood head and tail together, side by side,
each thrashing the flies from the other&#8217;s face and dozing
until hunger or thirst aroused them or perversity
took them away. Against the cool face of the cliff
the buzzards moped and stretched their dirty wings
in squalid discomfort; the trim little sparrow-hawks
gave over their hunting; and all the world lay tense
and still. Only at the ranch house where Hardy
kept a perfunctory watch was there any sign of
motion or life.</p>
<p>For two weeks now he had been alone, ever since
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
Jeff went down to Bender, and with the solitary&#8217;s
dread of surprise he stepped out into the <i>ramada</i>
regularly, scanning the western trail with eyes grown
weary of the earth&#8217;s emptiness.</p>
<p>At last as the sun sank low, throwing its fiery glare
in his eyes, he saw the familiar figure against the
sky&ndash;&ndash;Creede, broad and bulky and topped by his
enormous hat, and old Bat Wings, as raw-boned and
ornery as ever. Never until that moment had Hardy
realized how much his life was dependent upon this
big, warm-hearted barbarian who clung to his native
range as instinctively as a beef and yet possessed human
attributes that would win him friends anywhere
in the world. Often in that long two weeks he had reproached
himself for abandoning Jeff in his love-making.
What could be said for a love which made
a man so pitiless? Was it worthy of any return?
Was it, after all, a thing to be held so jealously to his
heart, gnawing out his vitals and robbing him of his
humanity? These and many other questions Hardy
had had time to ask himself in his fortnight of introspection
and as he stood by the doorway waiting he
resolved to make amends. From a petty creature
wrapped up in his own problems and prepossessions
he would make himself over into a man worthy of the
name of friend. Yet the consciousness of his fault
lay heavy upon him and as Creede rode in he stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
silent, waiting for him to speak. But Jeff for his part
came on grimly, and there was a sombre glow in his
eyes which told more than words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, sport,&#8221; he said, smiling wantonly, &#8220;could
you take a pore feller in over night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing, I can,&#8221; responded Hardy gayly.
&#8220;Where&#8217;ve you been all the time?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Creede chanted:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;Down to Bender,<br />
On a bender,<br />
Oh, I&#8217;m a spender,<br />
You bet yer life!</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m broke, too,&#8221; he added, <i>sotto voce</i>, dropping
off his horse and sinking into a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t need to let that worry you,&#8221; said
Hardy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got plenty. Here!&#8221; He went down
into his pocket and tossed a gold piece to him, but
Creede dodged it listlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; he said, &#8220;money&#8217;s nothin&#8217; to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Hardy anxiously.
&#8220;Are you sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Creede, nodding his head wearily,
&#8220;sick and tired of it all.&#8221; He paused and regarded
his partner solemnly. &#8220;I&#8217;m a miserable failure,
Rufe,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t <i>got</i> nothin&#8217; and I ain&#8217;t <i>worth</i>
nothin&#8217;. I never <i>done</i> nothin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;and I ain&#8217;t got a
friend in the world.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span></div>
<p>He stopped and gazed at the barren land despondently,
waiting to see if his partner would offer any
protests.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rufe,&#8221; he said, at last, his voice tremulous with
reproach, &#8220;if you&#8217;d only helped me out a little on that
letter&ndash;&ndash;if you&#8217;d only told me a few things&ndash;&ndash;well,
she might have let me down easy, and I could&#8217;ve took
it. As it was, she soaked me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then it was that Hardy realized the burden under
which his partner was laboring, the grief that clutched
at his heart, the fire that burned in his brain, and he
could have wept, now that it was too late.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeff,&#8221; he said honestly, &#8220;it don&#8217;t do any good
now, but I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m more than sorry&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
ashamed. But <i>that</i> don&#8217;t do you any good either, does
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stepped over and laid his hand affectionately
upon his partner&#8217;s shoulder, but Creede hunched it
off impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, slowly and deliberately, &#8220;not a dam&#8217;
bit.&#8221; There was no bitterness in his words, only an acknowledgment
of the truth. &#8220;They was only one thing
for me to do after I received that letter,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;and I done it. I went on a hell-roarin&#8217; drunk.
That&#8217;s right. I filled up on that forty-rod whiskey
until I was crazy drunk, an&#8217; then I picked out the
biggest man in town and fought him to a whisper.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span></div>
<p>He sighed and glanced at his swollen knuckles,
which still showed the marks of combat.</p>
<p>&#8220;That feller was a jim-dandy scrapper,&#8221; he said,
smiling magnanimously, &#8220;but I downed &#8217;im, all right.
I couldn&#8217;t quite lick the whole town, but I tried;
and I certainly gave &#8217;em a run for their money, while
it lasted. If Bender don&#8217;t date time from Jeff
Creede&#8217;s big drunk I miss my guess a mile. And you
know, after I got over bein&#8217; fightin&#8217; drunk, I got
cryin&#8217; drunk&ndash;&ndash;but I never did get drunk enough to
tell my troubles, thank God! The fellers think I&#8217;m
sore over bein&#8217; sheeped out. Well, after I&#8217;d punished
enough booze to start an Injun uprisin&#8217;, and
played the faro bank for my wad, I went to sleep; and
when I woke up it seemed a lo-ong time ago and I
could look back and see jest how foolish I&#8217;d been.
I could see how she&#8217;d jollied me up and got me
comin&#8217;, playin&#8217; me off against Bill Lightfoot; and then
I could see how she&#8217;d tantalized me, like that mouse
the cat had when you was down in Bender; and then
I could see where I had got the big-head bad, thinkin&#8217;
I was the only one&ndash;&ndash;and all the time she was <i>laughin&#8217;</i>
at me! Oh, it&#8217;s nothin&#8217; now&ndash;&ndash;I kin laugh at it myself
in a month; but I&#8217;m so dam&#8217; <i>&#8217;shamed</i> I could
cry.&#8221; He lopped down in his chair, a great hulk of
a man, and shook his head gloomily.</p>
<p>&#8220;They ain&#8217;t but one girl I ever knowed,&#8221; he said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
solemnly, &#8220;that wasn&#8217;t stringin&#8217; me, and that was
Sallie Winship. Sal liked me, dam&#8217;d if she
didn&#8217;t. She cried when she went away, but the
old lady wouldn&#8217;t stand for no bow-legged cowpuncher&ndash;&ndash;and
so I git euchred, every time.&#8221;</p>
<p>For lack of some higher consolation Hardy cooked
up a big supper for his low-spirited partner, and
after he had done the honors at the feast the irrepressible
good health of the cowboy rose up and conquered
his grief in spite of him. He began by telling the
story of his orgy, which apparently had left Bender
a wreck. The futile rage of Black Tex, the despair
of the town marshal, the fight with the Big Man, the
arrest by the entire <i>posse comitatus</i>, the good offices
of Mr. Einstein in furnishing bail, the crying and
sleeping jags&ndash;&ndash;all were set forth with a vividness
which left nothing to the imagination, and at the end
the big man was comforted. When it was all over
and his memory came down to date he suddenly recalled
a package of letters that were tied up in
his coat, which was still on the back of his saddle.
He produced them forthwith and, like a hungry boy
who sees others eat, sat down to watch Rufe read.
No letters ever came for him&ndash;&ndash;and when one did
come it was bad. The first in the pack was from
Lucy Ware and as Hardy read it his face softened,
even while he knew that Creede was watching.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Say, she&#8217;s all right, ain&#8217;t she?&#8221; observed Jeff,
when his partner looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Hardy, &#8220;and she says to take
you on again as foreman and pay you for every day
you didn&#8217;t carry your gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; cried Creede, and then he laughed quietly
to himself. &#8220;Does that include them days I was
prizin&#8217; up hell down in Bender? Oh, it does, eh?
Well, you can tell your boss that I&#8217;ll make that up
to her before the Summer&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaned back and stretched his powerful arms as
if preparing for some mighty labor. &#8220;We&#8217;re goin&#8217;
to have a drought this Summer,&#8221; he said impressively,
&#8220;that will have the fish packin&#8217; water in canteens.
Yes, sir, the chaser is goin&#8217; to cost more than the
whiskey before long; and they&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be some
dead cows along the river. Do you know what Pablo
Moreno is doin&#8217;? He&#8217;s cuttin&#8217; brush already to feed
his cattle. That old man is a wise <i>hombre</i>, all right,
when it comes to weather. He&#8217;s been hollerin&#8217; &#8216;<i>A&ntilde;o
seco, a&ntilde;o seco</i>,&#8217; for the last year, and now, by Joe,
we&#8217;ve got it! They ain&#8217;t hardly enough water in the
river to make a splash, and here it&#8217;s the first of June.
We&#8217;ve been kinder wropt up in fightin&#8217; sheep and
sech and hain&#8217;t noticed how dry it&#8217;s gittin&#8217;; but that
old feller has been sittin&#8217; on top of his hill watchin&#8217;
the clouds, and smellin&#8217; of the wind, and measurin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
the river, and countin&#8217; his cows until he&#8217;s a weather
sharp. I was a-ridin&#8217; up the river this afternoon
when I see the old man cuttin&#8217; down a <i>palo verde</i> tree,
and about forty head of cattle lingerin&#8217; around to eat
the top off as soon as she hit the ground; and he says
to me, kinder solemn and fatherly:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Jeff,&#8217; he says, &#8216;cut trees for your cattle&ndash;&ndash;this
is an <i>a&ntilde;o seco</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, I&#8217;ve heard that before,&#8217; says I. &#8216;But my
cows is learnin&#8217; to climb.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Stawano</i>,&#8217; he says, throwin&#8217; out his hands like I
was a hopeless proposition. But all the same I think
I&#8217;ll go out to-morrow and cut down one of them <i>palo
verdes</i> like he show&#8217;d me&ndash;&ndash;one of these kind with
little leaves and short thorns&ndash;&ndash;jest for an expeeriment.
If the cattle eat it, w&#8217;y maybe I&#8217;ll cut another,
but I don&#8217;t want to be goin&#8217; round stuffin&#8217; my cows
full of twigs for nothin&#8217;. Let &#8217;em rustle for their
feed, same as I do. But honest to God, Rufe, some
of them little runty cows that hang around the river
can&#8217;t hardly cast a shadder, they&#8217;re that ganted, and
calves seems to be gittin&#8217; kinder scarce, too. But here&ndash;&ndash;git
busy, now&ndash;&ndash;here&#8217;s a letter you overlooked.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pawed over the pile purposefully and thrust a
pale blue envelope before Hardy&ndash;&ndash;a letter from
Kitty Bonnair. And his eyes took on a cold, fighting
glint as he observed the fatal handwriting.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span></div>
<p>&#8220;By God,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I hain&#8217;t figured out yet what
struck me! I never spoke a rough word to that girl
in my life, and she certainly gimme a nice kiss when
she went away. But jest as soon as I write her a love
letter, w&#8217;y she&ndash;&ndash;she&ndash;&ndash;W&#8217;y hell, Rufe, I wouldn&#8217;t
talk that way to a sheep-herder if he didn&#8217;t <i>know</i> no
better. Now you jest read that&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he fumbled in his
pocket and slammed a crumpled letter down before
his partner&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;and tell me if I&#8217;m wrong! No, I want
you to do it. Well, I&#8217;ll read it to you, then!&#8221;</p>
<p>He ripped open the worn envelope, squared his
elbows across the table, and opened the scented inclosure
defiantly, but before he could read it Hardy
reached out suddenly and covered it with his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t, Jeff,&#8221; he said, his face pale and
drawn. &#8220;It was all my fault&ndash;&ndash;I should have told
you&ndash;&ndash;but please don&#8217;t read it to me. I&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t
stand it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; retorted Creede coldly. &#8220;I
reckon you can stand it if I can. Now suppose you
wrote a real nice letter&ndash;&ndash;the best you knowed how&ndash;&ndash;to
your girl, and she handed you somethin&#8217; like
this: &#8216;My dear Mr. Creede, yore amazin&#8217; letter&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;
Here, what ye doin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t listen to it!&#8221; cried Hardy, snatching the
letter away, &#8220;it&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now lookee here, Rufe Hardy,&#8221; began Creede, rising
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
up angrily from his chair, &#8220;I want to tell you
right now that you&#8217;ve got to read that letter or lick
me&ndash;&ndash;and I doubt if you can do that, the way I
happen to be feelin&#8217;. You got me into this in the
first place and now, by God, you&#8217;ll see it out! Now
you <i>read</i> that letter and tell me if I&#8217;m wrong!&#8221;</p>
<p>He reared up his head as he spoke and Hardy saw
the same fierce gleam in his eyes that came when he
harried the sheep; but there was something beside
that moved his heart to pity. It was the lurking sadness
of a man deep hurt, who fights the whole world
in his anguish; the protest of a soul in torment, demanding,
like Job, that some one shall justify his
torture.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Jeff,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will read it&ndash;&ndash;only&ndash;&ndash;only
don&#8217;t crowd me for an answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spread the letter before him on the table and
saw in a kind of haze the angry zigzag characters that
galloped across the page, the words whose meaning
he did not as yet catch, so swiftly did his thoughts rise
up at sight of them. Years ago Kitty had written
him a letter and he had read it at that same table. It
had been a cruel letter, but unconsidered, like the tantrum
of a child. Yes, he had almost forgotten it,
but now like a sudden nightmare the old horror
clutched at his heart. He steadied himself, and the
words began to take form before him. Surely she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
would be gentle with Jeff, he was so big and kind.
Then he read on, slowly, grasping at the meaning,
and once more his eyes grew big with horror
at her words. He finished, and bowed his head upon
the table, while the barren room whirled before him.</p>
<p>From his place across the table the big cowboy
looked down upon him, grim and masterful, yet wondering
at his silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, am I wrong?&#8221; he demanded, but the little
man made no answer.</p>
<p>Upon the table before Hardy there lay another
letter, written in that same woman&#8217;s hand, a letter
to him, and the writing was smooth and fair. Jeff
had brought it to him, tied behind his saddle, and he
stood before him now, waiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I wrong?&#8221; he said again, but Hardy did not
answer in words. Holding the crumpled letter behind
him he took up his own fair missive&ndash;&ndash;such a
one as he would have died for in years gone by&ndash;&ndash;and
laid it on the fire, and when the tiny flame leaped up
he dropped the other on it and watched them burn
together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how about it?&#8221; inquired Creede, awed by
the long silence, but the little man only bowed his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who am I, to judge?&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE DROUGHT</h3>
</div>
<p>For a year the shadowy clouds had flitted past
Hidden Water, drifting like flocks of snowy
birds to their resting-place against the Peaks, and
as the wind raged and the darkness gathered the
cattle had raised their heads and bellowed, sniffing
the wet air. In Summer the thunder-heads had
mounted to high heaven and spread from east to west;
the heat lightning had played along the horizon at
night, restless and incessant; the sky had turned black
and the south wind had rushed up, laden with the
smell of distant showers. At last the rain had fallen,
graciously, bringing up grass and browse, and flowers
for those who sought them. But all the time the
water lay in black pools along the shrunken river,
trickling among the rocks and eddying around huge
snags of driftwood, clear, limpid, sparkling, yet
always less and less.</p>
<p>Where the winter floods had scoured the lowlands
clear, a fuzz of baby trees sprang up, growing to
a rank prosperity and dying suddenly beneath the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
sun. Along the river&#8217;s edge little shreds of watercress
took root and threw out sprouts and blossoms;
the clean water brought forth snaky eel-grass and
scum which fed a multitude of fishes; in the shadows
of deep rocks the great bony-tails and Colorado
River salmon lay in contented shoals, like hogs in
wallows, but all the time the water grew less and less.
At every shower the Indian wheat sprang up on the
mesas, the myriad grass-seeds germinated and
struggled forth, sucking the last moisture from the
earth to endow it with more seeds. In springtime
the deep-rooted mesquites and <i>palo verdes</i> threw out
the golden halo of their flowers until the ca&ntilde;ons were
aflame; the soggy <i>sahuaros</i> drank a little at each
sparse downpour and defied the drought; all the world
of desert plants flaunted their pigmented green
against the barren sky as if in grim contempt; but
the little streams ran weaker and weaker, creeping
along under the sand to escape the pitiless sun.</p>
<p>As Creede and Hardy rode out from Hidden
Water, the earth lay dead beneath their horses&#8217; feet&ndash;&ndash;stark
and naked, stripped to the rocks by the sheep.
Even on Bronco Mesa the ground was shorn of its
covering; the cloven hoofs of the sheep had passed
over it like a scalping knife, tearing off the last sun-blasted
fringe of grass. In open spaces where they
had not found their way the gaunt cattle still curled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
their hungry tongues beneath the bushes and fetched
out spears of grass, or licked the scanty Indian wheat
from the earth itself.</p>
<p>With lips as tough and leathery as their indurated
faces, the hardiest of them worked their way into
bunches of stick-cactus and <i>chollas</i>, breaking down the
guard of seemingly impenetrable spines and munching
on the juicy stalks; while along the ridges long-necked
cows bobbed for the high browse which the
sheep had been unable to reach.</p>
<p>The famine was upon them; their hips stood out
bony and unsightly above their swollen stomachs as
they racked across the benches, and their eyes were
wild and haggard. But to the eye of Creede, educated
by long experience, they were still strong and
whole. The weaklings were those that hung about
the water, foot-sore from their long journeyings to
the distant hills and too weary to return. At the
spring-hole at Carrizo they found them gathered, the
runts and roughs of the range; old cows with importunate
calves bunting at their flaccid udders; young
heifers, unused to rustling for two; <i>orehannas</i> with
no mothers to guide them to the feed; rough steers
that had been &#8220;busted&#8221; and half-crippled by some
reckless cowboy&ndash;&ndash;all the unfortunate and incapable
ones, standing dead-eyed and hopeless or limping
stiffly about.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span></div>
<p>A buzzard rose lazily from a carcass as they approached,
and they paused to note the brand. Then
Creede shook his head bodingly and rode into the
bunch by the spring. At a single glance the <i>rod&eacute;o</i>
boss recognized each one of them and knew from
whence he came. He jumped his horse at a wild
steer and started him toward the ridges; the cows
with calves he rounded up more gently, turning them
into the upper trail; the <i>orehannas</i>, poor helpless
orphans that they were, followed hopefully, leaving
one haggard-eyed old stag behind.</p>
<p>Creede looked the retreating band over critically
and shook his head again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; he observed, briefly; and then, unlocking
the ponderous padlock that protected their
cabin from hungry sheepmen, he went in and fetched
out the axe. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll cut a tree for that old stiff,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>From his stand by the long troughs where all the
mountain cattle watered in Summer, the disconsolate
old stag watched the felling of the tree curiously;
then after an interval of dreary contemplation, he
racked his hide-bound skeleton over to the place and
began to browse. Presently the rocks began to clatter
on the upper trail, and an old cow that had been
peering over the brow of the hill came back to get
her share. Even her little calf, whose life had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
cast in thorny ways, tried his new teeth on the tender
ends and found them good. The <i>orehannas</i> drifted
in one after the other, and other cows with calves,
and soon there was a little circle about the tree-top,
munching at the soft, brittle twigs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that settles it,&#8221; said Creede. &#8220;One of us
stays here and cuts brush, and the other works around
Hidden Water. This ain&#8217;t the first drought I&#8217;ve
been through, not by no means, and I&#8217;ve learned this
much: the Alamo can be dry as a bone and Carrizo,
too, but they&#8217;s always water here and at the home
ranch. Sooner or later every cow on the range will
be goin&#8217; to one place or the other to drink, and if
we give &#8217;em a little bait of brush each time it keeps
&#8217;em from gittin&#8217; too weak. As long as a cow will
rustle she&#8217;s all right, but the minute she&#8217;s too weak to
travel she gits to be a water-bum&ndash;&ndash;hangs around the
spring and drinks until she starves to death. But
if you feed &#8217;em a little every day they&#8217;ll drift back
to the ridges at night and pick up a little more. I&#8217;m
sorry for them lily-white hands of yourn, pardner,
but which place would you like to work at?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hidden Water,&#8221; replied Hardy, promptly, &#8220;and
I bet I can cut as many trees as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go you, for a fiver,&#8221; exclaimed Creede,
emulously. &#8220;Next time Rafael comes in tell him to
bring me up some more grub and baled hay, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span>
I&#8217;m fixed. And say, when you write to the boss
you can tell her I&#8217;ve traded my gun for an axe!&#8221;</p>
<p>As Hardy turned back towards home he swung in
a great circle and rode down the dry bed of the Alamo,
where water-worn bowlders and ricks of mountain
drift lay strewn for miles to mark the vanished stream.
What a power it had been in its might, floating sycamores
and ironwoods as if they were reeds, lapping
high against the granite walls, moving the very rocks
in its bed until they ground together! But now the
sand lay dry and powdery, the willows and water-moodies
were dead to the roots, and even the ancient
cottonwoods from which it derived its name were
dying inch by inch. A hundred years they had stood
there, defying storm and cloudburst, but at last the
drought was sucking away their life. On the mesa the
waxy greasewood was still verdant, the gorged
<i>sahuaros</i> stood like great tanks, skin-tight with bitter
juice, and all the desert trees were tipped with green;
but the children of the river were dying for a drink.</p>
<p>A string of cattle coming in from The Rolls
stopped and stared at the solitary horseman, head
up against the sky; then as he rode on they fell
in behind him, travelling the deep-worn trail that led
to Hidden Water. At the cleft-gate of the pass,
still following the hard-stamped trail, Hardy turned
aside from his course and entered, curious to see his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span>
garden again before it succumbed to the drought.
There before him stood the sycamores, as green and
flourishing as ever; the eagle soared out from his cliff;
the bees zooned in their caves; and beyond the massive
dyke that barred the way the tops of the elders
waved the last of their creamy blossoms. In the deep
pool the fish still darted about, and the waterfall that
fed it was not diminished. The tinkle of its music
seemed even louder, and as Hardy looked below he
saw that a little stream led way from the pool, flowing
in the trench where the cattle came to drink. It
was a miracle, springing from the bosom of the earth
from whence the waters come. When all the world
outside lay dead and bare, Hidden Water flowed
more freely, and its garden lived on untouched.</p>
<p>Never had Hardy seen it more peaceful, and as
he climbed the Indian steps and stood beneath the
elder, where <i>Chupa Rosa</i> had built her tiny nest his
heart leapt suddenly as he remembered Lucy. Here
they had sat together in the first gladness of her coming,
reading his forgotten verse and watching the
eagle&#8217;s flight; only for that one time, and then the
fight with the sheep had separated them. He reached
up and plucked a spray of elder blossoms to send her
for a keep-sake&ndash;&ndash;and then like a blow he remembered
the forget-me-not! From that same garden
he had fetched her a forget-me-not for repentance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span>
and then forgotten her for Kitty. Who but Lucy
could have left the little book of poems, or treasured
a flower so long to give it back at parting? And
yet in his madness he had forgotten her!</p>
<p>He searched wistfully among the rocks for another
forget-me-not, but the hot breath of the drought had
killed them. As he climbed slowly down the stone
steps he mused upon some poem to take the place
of the flowers that were dead, but the spirit of the
drought was everywhere. The very rocks themselves,
burnt black by centuries of sun, were painted with
Indian prayers for rain. A thousand times he had
seen the sign, hammered into the blasted rocks&ndash;&ndash;the
helix, that mystic symbol of the ancients, a circle,
ever widening, never ending,&ndash;&ndash;and wondered at the
fate of the vanished people who had prayed to the
Sun for rain.</p>
<p>The fragments of their sacrificial <i>ollas</i> lay strewn
among the bowlders, but the worshippers were dead;
and now a stranger prayed to his own God for
rain. As he sat at his desk that night writing to
Lucy about the drought, the memory of those Indian
signs came upon him suddenly and, seizing a fresh
sheet of paper, he began to write. At the second
stanza he paused, planned out his rhymes and hurried
on again, but just as his poem seemed finished,
he halted at the last line. Wrestle as he would he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
could not finish it&ndash;&ndash;the rhymes were against him&ndash;&ndash;it
would not come right. Ah, that is what sets
the artist apart from all the under-world of dreamers&ndash;&ndash;his
genius endures to the end; but the near-poet
struggles like a bee limed in his own honey. What a
confession of failure it was to send away&ndash;&ndash;a poem
unfinished, or finished wrong! And yet&ndash;&ndash;the unfinished
poem was like him. How often in the past
had he left things unsaid, or said them wrong. Perhaps
Lucy would understand the better and prize it
for its faults. At last, just as it was, he sent it off,
and so it came to her hand.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>As it had been a thousand years before, so it was
that day at Hidden Water. The earth was dead,
it gave forth nothing; the sky was clean and hard,
without a cloud to soften its asperity. Another
month and the cattle would die; two months and
the water would fail; then in the last agonies of
starvation and thirst the dissolution would come&ndash;&ndash;the
Four Peaks would be a desert. Old Don Pablo
was right, the world was drying up. Chihuahua
and Sonora were parched; all Arizona lay stricken
with the drought; in California the cattle were dying
on the ranges, and in Texas and New Mexico the
same. God, what a thing&ndash;&ndash;to see the great earth
that had supported its children for ages slowly dying
for water, its deserts first, and then its rivers, and
then the pine-topped mountains that gave the rivers
birth! Yet what was there for a man to do but take
care of his own and wait? The rest was in the hands
of God.</p>
<p>On the first morning that Hardy took his axe and
went down to the river he found a single bunch of
gaunted cattle standing in the shade of the big mesquites
that grew against Lookout Point&ndash;&ndash;a runty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span>
cow with her two-year-old and yearling, and a
wobbly calf with a cactus joint stuck across his nose.
His mother&#8217;s face showed that she, too, had been
among the <i>chollas</i>; there was cactus in her knees
and long spines bristling from her jaws, but she
could stand it, while it was a matter of life and death
to the calf. Every time he came near his mother she
backed away, and whenever he began to nudge for
milk she kicked out wildly. So Hardy roped him and
twitched the joint away with a stick; then he pulled
out the thorns one by one and went about his work.</p>
<p>Selecting a fine-leaved <i>palo verde</i> that grew against
the point, he cleared a way into its trunk and felled
it down the hill. He cut a second and a third, and
when he looked back he saw that his labor was appreciated;
the runty cow was biting eagerly at the
first tree-top, and the wobbly calf was restored to
his own. As the sound of the axe continued, a band
of tame cattle came stringing down the sandy riverbed,
and before the morning was over there were ten
or twenty derelicts and water-bums feeding along
the hillside. In the afternoon he cut more trees along
the trail to Hidden Water, and the next day when
he went to work he found a little band of weaklings
there, lingering expectantly in the shadow of the
ca&ntilde;on wall. As the days went by more and more
of them gathered about the water, the lame, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span>
sick, the crippled, the discouraged, waiting for more
trees to be felled. Then as the feed on the distant
ridges grew thinner and the number of cut trees increased,
a great band of them hung about the vicinity
of the ranch house constantly&ndash;&ndash;the herds from Hidden
Water and the river, merged into one&ndash;&ndash;waiting
to follow him to the hills.</p>
<p>For a mile up and down the ca&ntilde;on of the Alamo,
the <i>palo verde</i> stumps dotted the hillside, each with
its top below it, stripped to the bark and bared of
every twig. As the breathless heat of July came on,
Hardy was up before dawn, hewing and felling, and
each day the long line of cattle grew. They trampled
at his heels like an army, gaunt, emaciated; mothers
mooing for their calves that lay dead along the
gulches; mountain bulls and outlaws, tamed by gnawing
hunger and weakness, and the awful stroke of the
heat. And every day other bands of outlaws, driven
at last from their native hills, drifted in to swell the
herd. For a month Hardy had not seen a human
face, nor had he spoken to any living creature except
Chapuli or some poor cow that lay dying by the
water. When he was not cutting trees on the farther
ridges, he was riding along the river, helping up
those that had fallen or dragging away the dead.</p>
<p>Worn and foot-sore, with their noses stuck full of
cactus joints, their tongues swollen from the envenomed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span>
thorns, their stomachs afire from thirst and
the burden of bitter stalks, the wild cattle from the
ridges would stagger down to the river and drink
until their flanks bulged out and their bellies hung
heavy with water. Then, overcome with fatigue and
heat, they would sink down in the shade and lie dreaming;
their limbs would stiffen and cramp beneath
them until they could not move; and there they would
lie helpless, writhing their scrawny necks as they
struggled to get their feet under them. To these
every day came Hardy with his rawhide <i>reata</i>.
Those that he could not scare up he pulled up; if
any had died he dragged the bodies away from the
water; and as soon as the recent arrivals had drunk
he turned them away, starting them on their long
journey to the high ridges where the sheep had not
taken the browse.</p>
<p>Ah, those sheep! How many times in the fever of
heat and work and weariness had Hardy cursed them,
his tongue seeking unbidden the wickedest words of
the range; how many times had he cursed Jim Swope,
and Jasper Swope, the Mexicans, and all who had
rushed in to help accomplish their ruin. And as the
sun beat down and no clouds came into the sky he
cursed himself, blindly, for all that had come to pass.
One man&ndash;&ndash;only one&ndash;&ndash;at the mouth of Hell&#8217;s Hip
Pocket, and the sheep might have been turned back;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span>
but he himself had seen the dust-cloud and let it pass&ndash;&ndash;and
for that the cattle died. The sheep were far
away, feeding peacefully in mountain valleys where
the pines roared in the wind and the nights were
cool and pleasant; but if the rain came and young
grass sprang up on Bronco Mesa they would come
again, and take it in spite of them. Yes, even if
the drought was broken and the cattle won back their
strength, that great army would come down from
the north once more and sheep them down to the
rocks! But one thing Hardy promised himself&ndash;&ndash;forgetting
that it was the bootless oath of old Bill
Johnson, who was crazy now and hiding in the hills&ndash;&ndash;he
would kill the first sheep that set foot on Bronco
Mesa, and the next, as long as he could shoot; and
Jasp Swope might answer as he would.</p>
<p>Yet, why think of sheep and schemes of belated
vengeance?&ndash;&ndash;the grass was gone; the browse was
cleaned; even the <i>palo verde</i> trees were growing
scarce. Day by day he must tramp farther and
farther along the ridge, and all that patient, trusting
army behind, waiting for him to find more trees!
Already the weakest were left behind and stood along
the trails, eying him mournfully; yet work as he
would he could not feed the rest. There was no fine-drawn
distinction now&ndash;&ndash;every <i>palo verde</i> on the hillside
fell before his axe, whether it was fine-leaved and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393' name='page_393'></a>393</span>
short-thorned, or rough and spiny; and the cattle
ate them all. Mesquite and cat-claw and ironwood,
tough as woven wire and barbed at every joint,
these were all that were left except cactus and the
armored <i>sahuaros</i>. In desperation he piled brush beneath
clumps of fuzzy <i>chollas</i>, the thorniest cactus
that grows, and burned off the resinous spines; but the
silky bundles of stickers still lurked beneath the ashes,
and the cattle that ate them died in agony.</p>
<p>Once more Hardy took his ax and went out in
search of <i>palo verdes</i>, high or low, young or old.
There was a gnarled trunk, curling up against a
rocky butte and protected by two spiny <i>sahuaros</i> that
stood before it like armed guards, and he climbed
up the rock to reach it. Chopping away the first
<i>sahuaro</i> he paused to watch it fall. As it broke open
like a giant melon on the jagged rocks below, the
cattle crowded about it eagerly, sniffing at the shattered
parts&ndash;&ndash;and then the hardiest of them began
suddenly to eat!</p>
<p>On the outside the wiry spines stood in rows like
two-inch knife blades; but now the juicy heart, laid
open by the fall, was exposed, and the cattle munched
it greedily. A sudden hope came to Hardy as he
watched them feed, and, climbing higher, he felled
two more of the desert giants, dropping them from
their foothold against the butte far down into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394' name='page_394'></a>394</span>
rocky ca&ntilde;on. As they struck and burst, and the
sickly aroma filled the air, the starved cattle, bitten
with a new appetite, rushed forward in hordes to eat
out their bitter hearts. At last, when the battle had
seemed all but over, he had found a new food,&ndash;&ndash;one
that even Pablo Moreno had overlooked,&ndash;&ndash;each plant
a ton of bitter pulp and juice. The coarse and wiry
spines, whose edges would turn an axe, were conquered
in a moment by the fall from the precipitous
cliffs. And the mesa was covered with them, like a
forest of towering pin-cushions, as far as the eye could
see! A great gladness came over Hardy as he saw
the starved cattle eat, and as soon as he had felled a
score or more he galloped up to Carrizo to tell the
news to Jeff.</p>
<p>The mesa was deserted of every living creature.
There was not a snake track in the dust or a raven in
the sky, but as he topped the brow of the hill and
looked down into the ca&ntilde;on, Hardy saw a great herd
of cattle, and Creede in the midst of them still hacking
away at the thorny <i>palo verdes</i>. At the clatter
of hoofs, the big man looked up from his work, wiping
the sweat and grime from his brow, and his face was
hard and drawn from working beyond his strength.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he called. &#8220;How&#8217;s things down your way&ndash;&ndash;water
holdin&#8217; out? Well, you&#8217;re in luck, then;
I&#8217;ve had to dig the spring out twice, and you can see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395' name='page_395'></a>395</span>
how many cows I&#8217;m feedin&#8217;. But say,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;d&#8217;ye think it&#8217;s as hot as this down in hell? Well,
if I thought for a minute it&#8217;d be as dry I&#8217;d take a
big drink and join the church, you can bet money on
that. What&#8217;s the matter&ndash;&ndash;have you got enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got enough of cutting <i>palo verdes</i>,&#8221; replied
Hardy, &#8220;but you just lend me that axe for a minute
and I&#8217;ll show you something.&#8221; He stepped to the
nearest <i>sahuaro</i> and with a few strokes felled it down
the hill, and when Creede saw how the cattle crowded
around the broken trunk he threw down his hat and
swore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&ndash;&ndash;damn&ndash;&ndash;me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for a pin-head!
Here I&#8217;ve been cuttin&#8217; these ornery <i>palo verdes</i> until
my hands are like a Gila monster&#8217;s back, and now
look at them cows eat giant cactus! There&#8217;s no use
talkin&#8217;, Rufe, the feller that wears the number five
hat and the number forty jumper ain&#8217;t worth hell-room
when you&#8217;re around&ndash;&ndash;here, gimme that axe!&#8221;
He seized it in his thorn-scarred hands and whirled
into the surrounding giants like a fury; then when he
had a dozen fat <i>sahuaros</i> laid open among the rocks
he came back and sat down panting in the scanty
shade of an ironwood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sore on myself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But that&#8217;s the
way it is! If I&#8217;d had the brains of a rabbit I&#8217;d&#8217;ve
stopped Jasp Swope last Spring&ndash;&ndash;then I wouldn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span>
need to be cuttin&#8217; brush here all Summer like a Mexican
wood-chopper. That&#8217;s where we fell down&ndash;&ndash;lettin&#8217;
them sheep in&ndash;&ndash;and now we&#8217;ve got to sweat
for it. But lemme tell you, boy,&#8221; he cried, raising a
mighty fist, &#8220;if I can keep jest one cow alive until Fall
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to meet Mr. Swope on the edge of my range
and shoot &#8217;im full of holes! Nothin&#8217; else will do,
somebody has got to be <i>killed</i> before this monkey business
will stop! I&#8217;ve been makin&#8217; faces and skinnin&#8217;
my teeth at that dastard long enough now, and I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to make him fight if I have to put high-life on
&#8217;im!&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped and looked out over the hillside where
the heat quivered in rainbows from the rocks, and the
naked <i>palo verdes</i>, stripped of their bark, bleached
like skeletons beside their jagged stumps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Rufe,&#8221; he began, abruptly, &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head slowly and sighed. &#8220;I always
thought I was,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;but old Bill Johnson
blew in on me the other day&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s crazy, you know&ndash;&ndash;and
when I see him I knowed it! W&#8217;y, pardner,
Bill is the most <i>reas-on-able</i> son-of-a-gun you can
imagine. You can talk to him by the hour, and outside
of bein&#8217; a little techy he&#8217;s all right; but the
minute you mention <i>sheep</i> to him his eye turns glassy
and he&#8217;s off. Well, that&#8217;s me, too, and has been for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span>
years, only not quite so bad; but then, Bill is plumb
sheeped out and I ain&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;quite!&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed mirthlessly and filled a cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; he said, squinting his eyes down
shrewdly, &#8220;that old feller ain&#8217;t so durned crazy yet.
He wanted some ammunition to shoot up sheep-camps
with, but bein&#8217; a little touched, as you might say, he
thought I might hold out on &#8217;im, so he goes at me like
this: &#8216;Jeff,&#8217; he says, &#8216;I&#8217;ve took to huntin&#8217; lions for
the bounty now&ndash;&ndash;me and the hounds&ndash;&ndash;and I want
to git some thirty-thirtys.&#8217; But after I&#8217;d give him
all I could spare he goes on to explain how the sheep,
not satisfied with eatin&#8217; &#8217;im out of house and home, had
gone and tolled all the lions away after &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;so, of
course, he&#8217;ll have to foller along, too. You catch
that, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Creede drooped his eyes significantly and smoked.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for old Bill Johnson,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;we wouldn&#8217;t have a live cow on our range to-day,
we&#8217;d&#8217;ve been sheeped down that close. When he&#8217;d
got his ammunition and all the bacon and coffee I
could spare he sat down and told me how he worked
it to move all them sheep last Spring. After he&#8217;d
made his first big play and see he couldn&#8217;t save the
Pocket he went after them sheepmen systematically
for his revenge. That thirty-thirty of his will shoot
nigh onto two miles if you hold it right, and every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398' name='page_398'></a>398</span>
time he sees a sheep-camp smoke he Injuned up onto
some high peak and took pot-shots at it. At the
distance he was you couldn&#8217;t hear the report&ndash;&ndash;and,
of course, you couldn&#8217;t <i>see</i> smokeless powder.
He says the way them Mexican herders took to the
rocks was a caution; and when the fireworks was over
they didn&#8217;t wait for orders, jest rounded up their
sheep and hiked!</p>
<p>&#8220;And I tell you, pardner,&#8221; said the big cowman
impressively, &#8220;after thinkin&#8217; this matter over in the
hot sun I&#8217;ve jest about decided to go crazy myself.
Yes, sir, the next time I hear a sheep-blat on Bronco
Mesa I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to tear my shirt gittin&#8217; to the high
ground with a thirty-thirty; and if any one should
inquire you can tell &#8217;em that your pore friend&#8217;s mind
was deranged by cuttin&#8217; too many <i>palo verdes</i>.&#8221; He
smiled, but there was a sinister glint in his eyes; and
as he rode home that night Hardy saw in the half-jesting
words a portent of the never-ending struggle
that would spring up if God ever sent the rain.</p>
<p>On the day after the visit to Carrizo a change came
over the sky; a haze that softened the edges of the
hills rose up along the horizon, and the dry wind died
away. As Hardy climbed along the rocky bluffs felling
the giant <i>sahuaros</i> down into the ravines for his
cattle, the sweat poured from his face in a stream.
A sultry heaviness hung over the land, and at night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399' name='page_399'></a>399</span>
as he lay beneath the <i>ramada</i> he saw the lightning,
hundreds of miles away, twinkling and playing along
the northern horizon. It was a sign&ndash;&ndash;the promise
of summer rain!</p>
<p>In the morning a soft wind came stealing in from
the west; a white cloud came up out of nothing and
hovered against the breast of the Peaks; and the summer
heat grew terrible. At noon the cloud turned
black and mounted up, its fluffy summit gleaming in
the light of the ardent sun; the wind whirled across
the barren mesa, sweeping great clouds of dust before
it, and the air grew damp and cool; then, as evening
came on the clouds vanished suddenly and the wind
died down to a calm. For a week the spectacle was
repeated&ndash;&ndash;then, at last, as if weary, the storm-wind
refused to blow; the thunder-caps no longer piled up
against the Peaks; only the haze endured, and the
silent, suffocating heat.</p>
<p>Day after day dragged by, and without thought or
hope Hardy plodded on, felling <i>sahuaros</i> into the
ca&ntilde;ons, his brain whirling in the fever of the great
heat. Then one day as the sun rose higher a gigantic
mass of thunder-clouds leapt up in the north, covering
half the sky. The next morning they rose again,
brilliant, metallic, radiating heat like a cone of fire.
The heavens were crowned with sudden splendor, the
gorgeous pageantry of summer clouds that rise rank
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_400' name='page_400'></a>400</span>
upon rank, basking like newborn cherubim in the
glorious light of the sun, climbing higher and higher
until they reached the zenith.</p>
<p>A moist breeze sprang up and rushed into the
storm&#8217;s black heart, feeding it with vapors from the
Gulf; then in the south, the home of the rain, another
great cloud arose, piling in fluffy billows against the
grim cliffs of the Superstitions and riding against
the flying cohorts that reared their snowy heads in the
north. The wind fell and all nature lay hushed and
expectant, waiting for the rain. The cattle would
not feed; the bearded ravens sat voiceless against
the cliffs; the gaunt trees and shrubs seemed to hold
up their arms&ndash;&ndash;for the rain that did not come. For
after all its pomp and mummery, its black mantle
that covered all the sky and the bravery of its trailing
skirts, the Storm, that rode in upon the wind like a
king, slunk away at last like a beaten craven. Its
black front melted suddenly, and its draggled banners,
trailing across the western sky, vanished utterly in the
kindling fires of sunset.</p>
<p>As he lay beneath the starlit sky that night, Hardy
saw a vision of the end, as it would come. He saw
the ca&ntilde;ons stripped clean of their high-standing
<i>sahuaros</i>, the spring at Carrizo dry, the river stinking
with the bodies of the dead&ndash;&ndash;even Hidden
Water quenched at last by the drought. Then a heavy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_401' name='page_401'></a>401</span>
sleep came upon him as he lay sprawling in the pitiless
heat and he dreamed&ndash;&ndash;dreamed of gaunt steers and
lowing cows, and skeletons, strewn along the washes;
of labor, never ending, and sweat, dripping from his
face. He woke suddenly with the horror still upon
him and gazed up at the sky, searching vainly for
the stars. The night was close and black, there was
a stir among the dead leaves as if a snake writhed
past, and the wind breathed mysteriously through the
bare trees; then a confused drumming came to his
ears, something warm and wet splashed against his
face, and into his outstretched hand God sent a drop
of rain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE FLOOD</h3>
</div>
<p>The rain came to Hidden Water in great drops,
warmed by the sultry air. At the first flurry the
dust rose up like smoke, and the earth hissed; then as
the storm burst in tropic fury the ground was struck
flat, the dust-holes caught the rush of water and held
it in sudden puddles that merged into pools and rivulets
and glided swiftly away. Like a famine-stricken
creature, the parched earth could not drink;
its bone-dry dust set like cement beneath the too generous
flood and refused to take it in&ndash;&ndash;and still the
rain came down in sluicing torrents that never stayed
or slackened. The cracked dirt of the <i>ramada</i> roof
dissolved and fell away, and the stick frame leaked
like a sieve. The rain wind, howling and rumbling
through the framework, hurled the water to the very
door where Hardy stood, and as it touched his face,
a wild, animal exultation overcame him and he dashed
out into the midst of it. God, it was good to feel
the splash of rain again, to lean against the wind, and
to smell the wet and mud! He wandered about
through it recklessly, now bringing in his saddle and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403' name='page_403'></a>403</span>
bedding, now going out to talk with his horse, at last
simply standing with his hands outstretched while his
whole being gloried in the storm.</p>
<p>As the night wore on and the swash of water became
constant, Hardy lay in his blankets listening to the
infinite harmonies that lurk in the echoes of rain,
listening and laughing when, out of the rumble of
the storm, there rose the deeper thunder of running
waters. Already the rocky slides were shedding the
downpour; the draws and gulches were leading it into
the creek. But above their gurgling murmur there
came a hoarser roar that shook the ground, reverberating
through the damp air like the diapason of
some mighty storm-piece. At daybreak he hurried
up the ca&ntilde;on to find its source, plunging along
through the rain until, on the edge of the bluff that
looked out up the Alamo, he halted, astounded at the
spectacle. From its cleft gate Hidden Water, once
so quiet and peaceful, was now vomiting forth mud,
rocks, and foaming waters in one mad torrent; it
overleapt the creek, piling up its debris in a solid
dam that stretched from bank to bank, while from
its lower side a great sluiceway of yellow water spilled
down into the broad bed of the Alamo.</p>
<p>Above the dam, where the ca&ntilde;on boxed in between
perpendicular walls, there lay a great lagoon, a lake
that rose minute by minute as if seeking to override
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404' name='page_404'></a>404</span>
its dam, yet held back by the torrent of sand and
water that Hidden Water threw across its path.
For an hour they fought each other, the Alamo striving
vainly to claim its ancient bed, Hidden Water
piling higher its hurtling barrier; then a louder roar
reverberated through the valley and a great wall of
dancing water swept down the ca&ntilde;on and surged into
the placid lake. On its breast it bore brush and sticks,
and trees that waved their trunks in the air like the
arms of some devouring monster as they swooped
down upon the dam. At last the belated waters from
above had come, the outpourings of a hundred mountain
creeks that had belched forth into the Alamo like
summer cloudbursts. The forefront of the mighty
storm-crest lapped over the presumptuous barrier in
one hissing, high-flung waterfall; then with a final
roar the dam went out and, as the bowlders groaned
and rumbled beneath the flood, the Alamo overleapt
them and thundered on.</p>
<p>A sudden sea of yellow water spread out over the
lower valley, trees bent and crashed beneath the
weight of drift, the pasture fence ducked under and
was gone. Still irked by its narrow bed the Alamo
swung away from the rock-bound bench where the
ranch house stood and, uprooting everything before
it, ploughed a new channel to the river. As it swirled
past, Hardy beheld a tangled wreckage of cottonwoods
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_405' name='page_405'></a>405</span>
and sycamores, their tops killed by the drought,
hurried away on this overplus of waters; the bare
limbs of <i>palo verdes</i>, felled by his own axe; and sun-dried
skeletons of cattle, light as cork, dancing and
bobbing as they drifted past the ranch.</p>
<p>The drought was broken, and as the rain poured
down it washed away all token of the past. Henceforward
there would be no sign to move the uneasy
spirit; no ghastly relic, hinting that God had once forgotten
them; only the water-scarred gulches and
ca&ntilde;ons, and the ricks of driftwood, piled high along
the valleys in memory of the flood. All day the rain
sluiced down, and the Alamo went wild in its might,
throwing a huge dam across the broad bed of the
river itself. But when at last in the dead of night the
storm-crest of the Salagua burst forth, raging from
its long jostling against chasm walls, a boom like a
thunder of cannon echoed from all the high cliffs by
Hidden Water; and the warring waters, bellowing
and tumbling in their titanic fury, joined together in a
long, mad race to the sea.</p>
<p>So ended the great flood; and in the morning the
sun rose up clean and smiling, making a diamond of
every dew-drop. Then once more the cattle gathered
about the house, waiting to be fed, and Hardy went
out as before to cut <i>sahuaros</i>. On the second day
the creek went down and the cattle from the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_406' name='page_406'></a>406</span>
bank came across, lowing for their share. But on the
third day, when the sprouts began to show on the
twining stick-cactus, the great herd that had dogged
his steps for months left the bitter <i>sahuaros</i> and scattered
across the mesa like children on a picnic, nipping
eagerly at every shoot.</p>
<p>In a week the flowers were up and every bush was
radiant with new growth. The grass crept out in
level places, and the flats in the valley turned green,
but the broad expanse of Bronco Mesa still lay half-barren
from paucity of seeds. Where the earth had
been torn up and trampled by the sheep the flood had
seized upon both soil and seed and carried them away,
leaving nothing but gravel and broken rocks; the
sheep-trails had turned to trenches, the washes to
gulches, the gulches to ravines; the whole mesa was
criss-crossed with tiny gullies where the water had
hurried away&ndash;&ndash;but every tree and bush was in its
glory, clothed from top to bottom in flaunting green.
Within a week the cattle were back on their old
ranges, all that were left from famine and drought.
Some there were that died in the midst of plenty, too
weak to regain their strength; others fell sick from
overeating and lost their hard-earned lives; mothers
remembered calves that were lost and bellowed mournfully
among the hills. But as rain followed rain and
the grass matured a great peace settled down upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_407' name='page_407'></a>407</span>
land; the cows grew round-bellied and sleepy-eyed,
the bulls began to roar along the ridges, and the Four
Peaks cattlemen rode forth from their mountain
valleys to see how their neighbors had fared.</p>
<p>They were a hard-looking bunch of men when they
gathered at the Dos S Ranch to plan for the fall
<i>rod&eacute;o</i>. Heat and the long drought had lined their
faces deep, their hands were worn and crabbed from
months of cutting brush, and upon them all was the
sense of bitter defeat. There would be no branding
in the pens that Fall&ndash;&ndash;the spring calves were all
dead; nor was there any use in gathering beef steers
that were sure to run short weight; there was nothing
to do, in fact, but count up their losses and organize
against the sheep. It had been a hard Summer, but
it had taught them that they must stand together or
they were lost. There was no one now who talked
of waiting for Forest Reserves, or of diplomacy and
peace&ndash;&ndash;every man was for war, and war from the
jump&ndash;&ndash;and Jefferson Creede took the lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fellers,&#8221; he said, after each man had had his say,
&#8220;there&#8217;s only one way to stop them sheep, and that is
to stop the first band. Never mind the man&ndash;&ndash;dam&#8217;
a herder, you can buy one for twenty dollars a month&ndash;&ndash;<i>git
the sheep</i>! Now suppose we stompede the first
bunch that comes on our range and scatter &#8217;em to hell&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s
<i>fif-teen thousand dol-lars gone</i>! God
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_408' name='page_408'></a>408</span>
A&#8217;mighty, boys, think of losin&#8217; that much real money
when you&#8217;re on the make like Jim Swope! W&#8217;y, Jim
would go crazy, he&#8217;d throw a fit&ndash;&ndash;and, more than
that, fellers,&#8221; he added, sinking his voice to a confidential
whisper, &#8220;he&#8217;d go round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, what ye goin&#8217; to do?&#8221; he continued, a
crafty gleam coming into his eye. &#8220;Are we goin&#8217; to
foller some cow&#8217;s tail around until they jump us
again? Are we goin&#8217; to leave Rufe here, to patrol a
hundred miles of range lone-handed? Not on your
life&ndash;&ndash;not me! We&#8217;re goin&#8217; to ride this range by
day&#8217;s works, fellers, and the first bunch of sheep we
find we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to scatter &#8217;em like shootin&#8217; stars&ndash;&ndash;and
if any man sees Jasp Swope I&#8217;ll jest ask him to
let me know. Is it a go? All right&ndash;&ndash;and I&#8217;ll tell
you how we&#8217;ll do.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only three places that the sheep can get
in on us: along the Alamo, over the Juate, or around
between the Peaks. Well, the whole caboodle of us
will camp up on the Alamo somewhere, and we&#8217;ll jest
naturally ride them three ridges night and day. I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to ask one of you fellers to ride away up north
and foller them sheepmen down, so they can&#8217;t come
a circumbendibus on us again. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to give
&#8217;em fair warnin&#8217; to keep off of our upper range, and
then the first wool-pullin&#8217; sheep-herder that sneaks in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_409' name='page_409'></a>409</span>
on Bronco Mesa is goin&#8217; to git the scare of his life&ndash;&ndash;and
the coyotes is goin&#8217; to git his sheep.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the only way to stop &#8217;em! W&#8217;y, Jim
Swope would run sheep on his mother&#8217;s grave if it
wasn&#8217;t for the five dollars fine. All right, then, we&#8217;ll
jest fine Mr. Swope fifteen thousand dollars for
comin&#8217; in on our range, and see if he won&#8217;t go around.
There&#8217;s only one thing that I ask of you fellers&ndash;&ndash;when
the time comes, for God&#8217;s sake <i>stick together</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>The time came in late October, when the sheep
were on The Rolls. In orderly battalions they
drifted past, herd after herd, until there were ten in
sight. If any sheepman resented the silent sentinels
that rode along the rim he made no demonstration of
the fact&ndash;&ndash;and yet, for some reason every herd sooner
or later wandered around until it fetched up against
the dead line. There were fuzzy <i>chollas</i> farther out
that got caught in the long wool and hurt the shearers&#8217;
hands; it was better to camp along the Alamo, where
there was water for their stock&ndash;&ndash;so the simple-minded
herders said, trying to carry off their bluff;
but when Creede scowled upon them they looked away
sheepishly. The <i>padron</i> had ordered it&ndash;&ndash;they could
say no more.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Muy bien</i>,&#8221; said the overbearing Grande, &#8220;and
where is your <i>padron</i>?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_410' name='page_410'></a>410</span></div>
<p>&#8220;<i>Quien sabe!</i>&#8221; replied the herders, hiking up their
shoulders and showing the palms of their hands, and
&#8220;Who knows&#8221; it was to the end. There was wise
counsel in the camp of the sheepmen; they never had
trouble if they could avoid it, and then only to gain a
point. But it was this same far-seeing policy which,
even in a good year when there was feed everywhere,
would not permit them to spare the upper range. For
two seasons with great toil and danger they had fought
their way up onto Bronco Mesa and established their
right to graze there&ndash;&ndash;to go around now would be to
lose all that had been gained.</p>
<p>But for once the cowmen of the Four Peaks were
equal to the situation. There were no cattle to gather,
no day herds to hold, no calves to brand in the pens&ndash;&ndash;every
man was riding and riding hard. There was
wood on every peak for signal fires and the main
camp was established on the high ridge of the Juate,
looking north and south and west. When that signal
rose up against the sky&ndash;&ndash;whether it was a smoke by
day or a fire by night&ndash;&ndash;every man was to quit his
post and ride to harry the first herd. Wherever or
however it came in, that herd was to be destroyed, not
by violence nor by any overt act, but by the sheepmen&#8217;s
own methods&ndash;&ndash;strategy and stealth.</p>
<p>For once there was no loose joint in the cordon of
the cowmen&#8217;s defence. From the rim of the Mogollons
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_411' name='page_411'></a>411</span>
to the borders of Bronco Mesa the broad trail of
the sheep was marked and noted; their shiftings and
doublings were followed and observed; the bitterness
of Tonto cowmen, crazy over their wrongs, was poured
into ears that had already listened to the woes of
Pleasant Valley. When at last Jasper Swope&#8217;s
boss herder, Juan Alvarez, the same man-killing Mexican
that Jeff Creede had fought two years before,
turned suddenly aside and struck into the old Shep
Thomas trail that comes out into the deep crotch between
the Peaks, a horseman in <i>chaparejos</i> rode on
before him, spurring madly to light the signal fires.
That night a fire blazed up from the shoulder of the
western mountain and was answered from the Juate.
At dawn ten men were in the saddle, riding swiftly,
with Jefferson Creede at their head.</p>
<p>It was like an open book to the cowmen now, that
gathering of the sheep along the Alamo&ndash;&ndash;a ruse, a
feint to draw them away from the Peaks while the
blow was struck from behind. Only one man was left
to guard that threatened border&ndash;&ndash;Rufus Hardy, the
man of peace, who had turned over his pistol to the
boss. It was a bitter moment for him when he saw
the boys start out on this illicit adventure; but for once
he restrained himself and let it pass. The war would
not be settled at a blow.</p>
<p>At the shoulder of the Peak the posse of cowmen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_412' name='page_412'></a>412</span>
found Jim Clark, his shaps frayed and his hat slouched
to a shapeless mass from long beating through the
brush, and followed in his lead to a pocket valley,
tucked away among the cedars, where they threw off
their packs and camped while Jim and Creede went
forward to investigate. It was a rough place, that
crotch between the Peaks, and Shep Thomas had cut
his way through chaparral that stood horse-high before
he won the southern slope. To the north the
brush covered all the ridges in a dense thicket, and it
was there that the cow camp was hid; but on the
southern slope, where the sun had baked out the soil,
the mountain side stretched away bare and rocky,
broken by innumerable ravines which came together
in a <i>redondo</i> or rounded valley and then plunged
abruptly into the narrow defile of a box ca&ntilde;on. This
was the middle fork, down which Shep Thomas had
made his triumphal march the year before, and down
which Juan Alvarez would undoubtedly march again.</p>
<p>Never but once had the sheep been in that broad
valley, and the heavy rains had brought out long tufts
of grama grass from the bunchy roots along the hillsides.
As Creede and Jim Clark crept up over the
brow of the western ridge and looked down upon it
they beheld a herd of forty or fifty wild horses, grazing
contentedly along the opposite hillside; and far below,
where the valley opened out into the <i>redondo</i>, they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_413' name='page_413'></a>413</span>
saw a band of their own tame horses feeding. Working
in from either side&ndash;&ndash;the wild horses from the
north, where they had retreated to escape the drought;
the range animals from the south, where the sheep had
fed off the best grass&ndash;&ndash;they had made the broad
mountain valley a rendezvous, little suspecting the
enemy that was creeping in upon their paradise. Already
the distant bleating of the sheep was in the air;
a sheepman rode up to the summit, looked over at the
promised land and darted back, and as the first struggling
mass of leaders poured out from the cut trail and
drifted down into the valley the wild stallions shook
out their manes in alarm and trotted farther away.</p>
<p>A second band of outlaws, unseen before, came galloping
along the western mountain side, snorting at
the clangor and the rank smell of the sheep, and
Creede eyed them with professional interest as the
leaders trotted past. Many times in the old days he
had followed along those same ridges, rounding up the
wild horses and sending them dashing down the
ca&ntilde;on, so that Hardy could rush out from his hiding
place and make his throw. It was a natural hold-up
ground, that <i>redondo</i>, and they had often talked of
building a horse trap there; but so far they had
done no more than rope a chance horse and let the
rest go charging down the box ca&ntilde;on and out the
other end onto Bronco Mesa.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_414' name='page_414'></a>414</span></div>
<p>It was still early in the morning when Juan
Alvarez rode down the pass and invaded the forbidden
land. He had the name of a bad <i>hombre</i>, this
boss herder of Jasper Swope, the kind that cuts
notches on his rifle stock. Only one man had ever
made Juan eat dirt, and that man now watched him
from the high rocks with eyes that followed every
move with the unblinking intentness of a mountain
lion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uhr-r! Laugh, you son of a goat,&#8221; growled
Creede, as the big Mexican pulled up his horse and
placed one hand complacently on his hip. &#8220;Sure,
make yourself at home,&#8221; he muttered, smiling as his
enemy drifted his sheep confidently down into the
<i>redondo</i>, &#8220;you&#8217;re goin&#8217; jest where I want ye. Come
sundown and we&#8217;ll go through you like a house afire.
If he beds in the <i>redondo</i> let&#8217;s shoot &#8217;em into that box
ca&ntilde;on, Jim,&#8221; proposed the big cowman, turning to
his partner, &#8220;and when they come out the other end
all hell wouldn&#8217;t stop &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;ll go forty ways
for Sunday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suits me,&#8221; replied Jim, &#8220;but say, what&#8217;s the
matter with roundin&#8217; up some of them horses and
sendin&#8217; &#8217;em in ahead? That boss Mexican is goin&#8217; to
take a shot at some of us fellers if we do the work
ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Jim,&#8221; said Creede, squinting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_415' name='page_415'></a>415</span>
shrewdly at the three armed herders. &#8220;<i>I&#8217;ll</i> tell ye,
let&#8217;s send them wild horses through &#8217;em! Holy
smoke! jest think of a hundred head of them outlaws
comin&#8217; down the ca&ntilde;on at sundown and hammerin&#8217;
through that bunch of sheep! And we don&#8217;t
need to git within gunshot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine and dandy,&#8221; commented Jim, &#8220;but how&#8217;re
you goin&#8217; to hold your horses to it? Them herders
will shoot off their guns and turn &#8217;em back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the matter with usin&#8217; our tame
horses for a hold-up herd and then sendin&#8217; the whole
bunch through together? They&#8217;ll strike for the box
ca&ntilde;on, you can bank on that, and if Mr. Juan will
<i>only</i>&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; But Mr. Juan was not so accommodating.
Instead of holding his sheep in the <i>redondo</i> he drifted
them up on the mountain side, where he could overlook
the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll fix you yet,&#8221; observed Creede, and leaving
Jim to watch he scuttled down to his horse and
rode madly back to camp.</p>
<p>That afternoon as Juan Alvarez stood guard upon
a hill he saw, far off to the west, four horsemen, riding
slowly across the mesa. Instantly he whistled to his
herders, waving his arms and pointing, and in a panic
of apprehension they circled around their sheep,
crouching low and punching them along until the herd
was out of sight. And still the four horsemen rode
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_416' name='page_416'></a>416</span>
on, drawing nearer, but passing to the south. But
the sheep, disturbed and separated by the change, now
set up a plaintive bleating, and the boss herder, never
suspecting the trap that was being laid for him,
scrambled quickly down from his lookout and drove
them into the only available hiding-place&ndash;&ndash;the box
ca&ntilde;on. Many years in the sheep business had taught
him into what small compass a band of sheep can be
pressed, and he knew that, once thrown together in the
dark ca&ntilde;on, they would stop their telltale blatting and
go to sleep. Leaving his herders to hold them there
he climbed back up to his peak and beheld the cowboys
in the near distance, but still riding east.</p>
<p>An hour passed and the sheep had bedded together
in silence, each standing with his head under another&#8217;s
belly, as is their wont, when the four horsemen, headed
by Jeff Creede himself, appeared suddenly on the distant
mountain side, riding hard along the slope. Galloping
ahead of them in an avalanche of rocks was the
band of loose horses that Alvarez had seen in the
<i>redondo</i> that morning, and with the instinct of their
kind they were making for their old stamping ground.</p>
<p>Once more the sheepman leaped up from his place
and scampered down the hill to his herd, rounding up
his pack animals as he ran. With mad haste he
shooed them into the dark mouth of the ca&ntilde;on, and
then hurried in after them like a badger that, hearing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_417' name='page_417'></a>417</span>
the sound of pursuers, backs into some neighboring
hole until nothing is visible but teeth and claws. So
far the boss herder had reasoned well. His sheep
were safe behind him and his back was against a rock;
a hundred men could not dislodge him from his position
if it ever came to a fight; but he had not
reckoned upon the devilish cunning of horse-taming
Jeff Creede. Many a time in driving outlaws to the
river he had employed that same ruse&ndash;&ndash;showing himself
casually in the distance and working closer as they
edged away until he had gained his end.</p>
<p>The sun was setting when Creede and his cowboys
came clattering down the mountain from the east and
spurred across the <i>redondo</i>, whooping and yelling as
they rounded up their stock. For half an hour they
rode and hollered and swore, apparently oblivious of
the filigree of sheep tracks with which the ground was
stamped; then as the <i>remuda</i> quieted down they
circled slowly around their captives, swinging their
wide-looped ropes and waiting for the grand stampede.</p>
<p>The dusk was beginning to gather in the low valley
and the weird evensong of the coyotes was at its height
when suddenly from the north there came a rumble,
as if a storm gathered above the mountain; then with
a roar and the thunder of distant hoofs, the crashing
of brush and the nearer click of feet against the rocks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_418' name='page_418'></a>418</span>
a torrent of wild horses poured over the summit of
the pass and swept down into the upper valley like an
avalanche. Instantly Creede and his cowboys scattered,
spurring out on either wing to turn them fair
for the box ca&ntilde;on, and the tame horses, left suddenly
to their own devices, stood huddled together in the
middle of the <i>redondo</i>, fascinated by the swift approach
of the outlaws. Down the middle of the broad
valley they came, flying like the wind before their
pursuers; at sight of Creede and his cowboys and the
familiar hold-up herd they swerved and slackened
their pace; then as the half-circle of yelling cowmen
closed in from behind they turned and rushed straight
for the box ca&ntilde;on, their flint-like feet striking like
whetted knives as they poured into the rocky pass.
Catching the contagion of the flight the tame horses
joined in of their own accord, and a howl of exultation
went up from the Four Peaks cowmen as they rushed
in to complete the overthrow. In one mad whirl they
mingled&ndash;&ndash;wild horses and tame, and wilder riders
behind; and before that irresistible onslaught Juan
Alvarez and his herders could only leap up and cling
to the rocky cliffs like bats. And the sheep! A minute
after, there were no sheep. Those that were not
down were gone&ndash;&ndash;scattered to the winds, lost, annihilated!</p>
<p>Seized by the mad contagion, the cowboys themselves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_419' name='page_419'></a>419</span>
joined in the awful rout, spurring through the
dark ca&ntilde;on like devils let loose from hell. There was
only one who kept his head and waited, and that was
Jefferson Creede. Just as the last wild rider flashed
around the corner he jumped his horse into the ca&ntilde;on
and, looking around, caught sight of Juan Alvarez,
half-distraught, crouching like a monkey upon a narrow
ledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&ndash;&ndash;the&ndash;&ndash;hell!&#8221; he cried, with well-feigned
amazement. &#8220;<i>I</i> didn&#8217;t know you was here!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheepman swallowed and blinked his eyes, that
stood out big and round like an owl&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; made a dam&#8217; bit of difference
if I had!&#8221; added Creede, and then, flashing his teeth
in a hectoring laugh, he put spurs to his horse and
went thundering after his fellows.</p>
<p>Not till that moment did the evil-eyed Juan
Alvarez sense the trick that had been played upon
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Cabrone!</i>&#8221; he screamed, and whipping out his
pistol he emptied it after Creede, but the bullets spattered
harmlessly against the rocks.</p>
<p>Early the next morning Jefferson Creede rode
soberly along the western rim of Bronco Mesa, his
huge form silhouetted against the sky, gazing down
upon the sheep camps that lay along the Alamo; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_420' name='page_420'></a>420</span>
the simple-minded Mexicans looked up at him in
awe. But when the recreant herders of Juan
Alvarez came skulking across the mesa and told the
story of the stampede, a sudden panic broke out that
spread like wildfire from camp to camp. Orders or
no orders, the timid Mexicans threw the sawhorses
onto their burros, packed up their blankets and
moved, driving their bawling sheep far out over The
Rolls, where before the <i>chollas</i> had seemed so bad.
It was as if they had passed every day beneath some
rock lying above the trail, until, looking up, they saw
that it was a lion, crouching to make his spring. For
years they had gazed in wonder at the rage and violence
of Grande Creede, marvelling that the <i>padron</i>
could stand against it; but now suddenly the big man
had struck, and <i>bravo</i> Juan Alvarez had lost his
sheep. Hunt as long as he would he could not bring
in a tenth of them. <i>Ay, que malo!</i> The boss would
fire Juan and make him walk to town; but they who
by some miracle had escaped, would flee while there
was yet time.</p>
<p>For two days Creede rode along the rim of Bronco
Mesa&ndash;&ndash;that dead line which at last the sheepmen
had come to respect,&ndash;&ndash;and when at last he sighted
Jim Swope coming up from Hidden Water with two
men who might be officers of the law he laughed and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_421' name='page_421'></a>421</span>
went to meet them. Year in and year out Jim
Swope had been talking law&ndash;&ndash;law; now at last they
would see this law, and find out what it could do.
One of the men with Swope was a deputy sheriff,
Creede could tell that by his star; but the other man
might be almost anything&ndash;&ndash;a little fat man with a
pointed beard and congress shoes; a lawyer, perhaps,
or maybe some town detective.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this Mr. Creede?&#8221; inquired the deputy, casually
flashing his star as they met beside the trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my name,&#8221; replied Creede. &#8220;What can
I do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Creede,&#8221; responded the officer, eying
his man carefully, &#8220;I come up here to look into the
killing of Juan Alvarez, a Mexican sheep-herder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The killin&#8217;?&#8221; echoed Creede, astounded.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; snapped the deputy sheriff, trying
to get the jump on him. &#8220;What do you know about
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&ndash;&ndash;me?&#8221; answered the cowman, his eyes
growing big and earnest as he grasped the news.
&#8220;Not a thing. The last time I saw Juan Alvarez he
was standin&#8217; on a ledge of rocks way over yonder in
the middle fork&ndash;&ndash;and he certainly was all right
then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes? And when was this, Mr. Creede?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_422' name='page_422'></a>422</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Day before yesterday, about sundown.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Day before yesterday, eh? And just what was
you doin&#8217; over there at the time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell ye,&#8221; began Creede circumstantially.
&#8220;Me and Ben Reavis and a couple of the boys had
gone over toward the Pocket to catch up our horses.
They turned back on us and finally we run &#8217;em into
that big <i>redondo</i> up in the middle fork. I reckon we
was ridin&#8217; back and forth half an hour out there gittin&#8217;
&#8217;em stopped, and we never heard a peep out of this
Mexican, but jest as we got our <i>remuda</i> quieted down
and was edgin&#8217; in to rope out the ones we wanted, here
comes a big band of wild horses that the other boys
had scared up over behind the Peaks, roaring down
the ca&ntilde;on and into us. Of course, there was nothin&#8217;
for it then but to git out of the way and let &#8217;em pass,
and we did it, dam&#8217; quick. Well, sir, that bunch of
wild horses went by us like the mill tails of hell, and
of course our <i>remuda</i> stompeded after &#8217;em and the
whole outfit went bilin&#8217; through the box ca&ntilde;on, where
it turned out Juan Alvarez had been hidin&#8217; his sheep.
That&#8217;s all I know about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, did you have any trouble of any kind with
this deceased Mexican, Mr. Creede? Of course you
don&#8217;t need to answer that if it will incriminate you,
but I just wanted to know, you understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; responded the cowman, waving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_423' name='page_423'></a>423</span>
the suggestion aside with airy unconcern. &#8220;This
is the first I&#8217;ve heard of any killin&#8217;, but bein&#8217; as
you&#8217;re an officer I might as well come through with
what I know. I don&#8217;t deny for a minute that I&#8217;ve
had trouble with Juan. I had a fist fight with him
a couple of years ago, and I licked him, too&ndash;&ndash;but
seein&#8217; him up on that ledge of rocks when I rode
through after my horses was certainly one of the big
surprises of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh, you was surprised, was ye?&#8221; snarled Swope,
who had been glowering at him malignantly through
his long recital. &#8220;Mebbe&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I was surprised!&#8221; retorted Creede angrily.
&#8220;And I was like the man that received the gold-headed
cane&ndash;&ndash;I was <i>pleased</i>, too, if that&#8217;s what
you&#8217;re drivin&#8217; at. I don&#8217;t doubt you and Jasp sent
that dam&#8217; Greaser in there to sheep us out, and if he
got killed you&#8217;ve got yourself to thank for it. He
had no business in there, in the first place, and in the
second place, I gave you fair warnin&#8217; to keep &#8217;im
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You hear that, Mr. Officer?&#8221; cried the sheepman.
&#8220;He admits making threats against the deceased;
he&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a moment, just a moment, Mr. Swope,&#8221; interposed
the deputy sheriff pacifically. &#8220;Did you
have any words with this Juan Alvarez, Mr. Creede,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_424' name='page_424'></a>424</span>
when you saw him in the ca&ntilde;on? Any trouble of any
kind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we didn&#8217;t have what you might call trouble&ndash;&ndash;that
is, nothin&#8217; serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, just what words passed between you? This
gentleman here is the coroner; we&#8217;ve got the body
down at the ranch house, and we may want to suppeenie
you for the inquest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to meet you, sir,&#8221; said Creede politely.
&#8220;Well, all they was to it was this: when I rode in
there and see that dam&#8217; Mexican standin&#8217; up on a
ledge with his eyes bulgin&#8217; out, I says, &#8216;What in hell&ndash;&ndash;<i>I</i>
didn&#8217;t know you was here!&#8217; And he says,
&#8216;Oh, that&#8217;s all right.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest listen to the son-of-a-gun lie!&#8221; yelled Jim
Swope, beside himself with rage. &#8220;<i>Listen</i> to him!
He said that was all right, did he? Three thousand
head of sheep stompeded&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; roared Creede, &#8220;he said: &#8216;That&#8217;s all right.&#8217;
And what&#8217;s more, there was another Mexican there
that heard him! Now how about it, officer; how
much have I got to take off this dam&#8217; sheep puller
before I git the right to talk back? Is he the judge
and jury in this matter, or is he just a plain buttinsky?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to ask you gentlemen to key down a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_425' name='page_425'></a>425</span>
little,&#8221; replied the deputy noncommittally, &#8220;and let&#8217;s
get through with this as soon as possible. Now, Mr.
Creede, you seem to be willing to talk about this
matter. I understand that there was some shots
fired at the time you speak of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; replied Creede. &#8220;Juan took a
couple of shots at me as I was goin&#8217; down the ca&ntilde;on.
He looked so dam&#8217; funny, sittin&#8217; up on that ledge like
a monkey-faced owl, that I couldn&#8217;t help laughin&#8217;,
and of course it riled him some. But that&#8217;s all right&ndash;&ndash;I
wouldn&#8217;t hold it up against a dead man.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deputy sheriff laughed in spite of himself, and
the coroner chuckled, too. The death of a Mexican
sheep-herder was not a very sombre matter to gentlemen
of their profession.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you were armed?&#8221; inquired the coroner
casually.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had my six-shooter in my shaps, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, is that the gun? What calibre is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A forty-five.&#8221;</p>
<p>The officers of the law glanced at each other knowingly,
and the deputy turned back toward the ranch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The deceased was shot with a thirty-thirty,&#8221; observed
the coroner briefly, and there the matter was
dropped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Umm, a thirty-thirty,&#8221; muttered Creede, &#8220;now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_426' name='page_426'></a>426</span>
who in&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He paused and nodded his head, and a
look of infinite cunning came into his face as he
glanced over his shoulder at the retreating posse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill Johnson!&#8221; he said, and then he laughed&ndash;&ndash;but
it was not a pleasant laugh.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>PORTENTS OF WAR</h3>
</div>
<p>There were signs of impending war on Bronco
Mesa. As God sent the rain and the flowers and
grass sprang up they grappled with each other like
murderers, twining root about root for the water,
fighting upward for the light&ndash;&ndash;and when it was over
the strongest had won. Every tree and plant on that
broad range was barbed and fanged against assault;
every creature that could not flee was armed for its
own defence; it was a land of war, where the strongest
always won. What need was there for words?
Juan Alvarez was dead, shot from some distant peak
while rounding up his sheep&ndash;&ndash;and his sheep, too,
were dead.</p>
<p>They buried the boss herder under a pile of rocks
on Lookout Point and planted a cross above him, not
for its Christian significance, nor yet because Juan
was a good Catholic, but for the Mexicans to look at
in the Spring, when the sheep should come to cross.
Jim Swope attended to this himself, after the coroner
had given over the body, and for a parting word he
cursed Jeff Creede.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_428' name='page_428'></a>428</span></div>
<p>Then for a day the world took notice of their
struggle&ndash;&ndash;the great outside world that had left them
to fight it out. Three thousand head of sheep had
been killed; mutton enough to feed a great city for a
day had been destroyed&ndash;&ndash;and all in a quarrel over
public land. The word crept back to Washington,
stripped to the bare facts&ndash;&ndash;three thousand sheep and
their herder killed by cattlemen on the proposed
Salagua Reserve&ndash;&ndash;and once more the question rose,
Why was not that Salagua Reserve proclaimed? No
one answered. There was another sheep and cattle
war going on up in Wyoming, and the same question
was being asked about other proposed reserves.
But when Congress convened in December the facts
began to sift out: there was a combination of railroad
and lumber interests, big cattlemen, sheepmen,
and &#8220;land-grabbers&#8221; that was &#8220;against any interference
on the part of the Federal Government,&#8221; and
&#8220;opposed to any change of existing laws and customs
as to the grazing of live stock upon the public
domain.&#8221; This anomalous organization was fighting,
and for years had been fighting, the policy of the administration
to create forest reserves and protect the
public land; and, by alliances with other anti-administration
forces in the East, had the President and his
forester at their mercy. There would be no forestry
legislation that Winter&ndash;&ndash;so the newspapers said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_429' name='page_429'></a>429</span>
But that made no difference to the Four Peaks
country.</p>
<p>Only faint echoes of the battle at Washington
reached the cowmen&#8217;s ears, and they no longer gave
them any heed. For years they had been tolled along
by false hopes; they had talked eagerly of Forest
Rangers to draw two-mile circles around their poor
ranches and protect them from the sheep; they had
longed to lease the range, to pay grazing fees, anything
for protection. But now they had struck the
first blow for themselves, and behold, on the instant
the sheep went round, the grass crept back onto the
scarred mesa, the cattle grew fat on the range! Juan
Alvarez, to be sure, was dead; but their hands were
clean, let the sheepmen say what they would. What
were a few sheep carcasses up on the high mesa?
They only matched the cattle that had died off during
the drought. When they met a sheep-herder now
he gave them the trail.</p>
<p>Tucked away in a far corner of the Territory, without
money, friends, or influence, there was nothing for
it but to fight. All nature seemed conspiring to encourage
them in their adventure&ndash;&ndash;the Winter came
on early, with heavy rains; the grass took root again
among the barren rocks and when, in a belated <i>rod&eacute;o</i>,
they gathered their beef steers, they received the highest
selling price in years. All over Arizona, and in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_430' name='page_430'></a>430</span>
California, New Mexico, and Texas, the great
drought had depleted the ranges; the world&#8217;s supply
of beef had been cut down; feeders were scarce in the
alfalfa fields of Moroni; fat cattle were called for
from Kansas City to Los Angeles; and suddenly the
despised cowmen of the Four Peaks saw before them
the great vision which always hangs at the end of the
rainbow in Arizona&ndash;&ndash;a pot of gold, <i>if the sheep went
around</i>. And what would make the sheep go around?
Nothing but a thirty-thirty.</p>
<p>The price of mutton had gone up too, adding a third
to the fortune of every sheepman; the ewes were lambing
on the desert, bringing forth a hundred per cent
or better, with twins&ndash;&ndash;and every lamb must eat! To
the hundred thousand sheep that had invaded Bronco
Mesa there was added fifty thousand more, and they
must all eat. It was this that the sheepmen had foreseen
when they sent Juan Alvarez around to raid the
upper range&ndash;&ndash;not that they needed the feed then,
but they would need it in the Spring, and need it bad.
So they had tried to break the way and, failing, had
sworn to come in arms. It was a fight for the grass,
nothing less, and there was no law to stop it.</p>
<p>As the news of the trouble filtered out and crept
into obscure corners of the daily press, Hardy received
a long hortatory letter from Judge Ware; and,
before he could answer it, another. To these he answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_431' name='page_431'></a>431</span>
briefly that the situation could only be relieved
by some form of Federal control; that, personally,
his sympathies were with the cattlemen, but, in case
the judge was dissatisfied with his services&ndash;&ndash;But
Judge Ware had learned wisdom from a past experience
and at this point he turned the correspondence
over to Lucy. Then in a sudden fit of exasperation
he packed his grip and hastened across the continent
to Washington, to ascertain for himself why the
Salagua Forest Reserve was not proclaimed. As for
Lucy, her letters were as carefully considered as ever&ndash;&ndash;she
wrote of everything except the sheep and Kitty
Bonnair. Not since she went away had she mentioned
Kitty, nor had Hardy ever inquired about her. In
idle moments he sometimes wondered what had been
in that unread letter which he had burned with
Creede&#8217;s, but he never wrote in answer, and his heart
seemed still and dead. For years the thought of
Kitty Bonnair had haunted him, rising up in the long
silence of the desert; in the rush and hurry of the
round-up the vision of her supple form, the laughter
of her eyes, the succession of her moods, had danced
before his eyes in changing pictures, summoned up
from the cherished past; but now his mind was filled
with other things. Somewhere in the struggle against
sheep and the drought he had lost her, as a man loses
a keep-sake which he has carried so long against his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_432' name='page_432'></a>432</span>
heart that its absence is as unnoticed as its presence,
and he never knows himself the poorer. After the
drought had come the sheep, the stampede, fierce quarrels
with the Swopes, threats and counter-threats&ndash;&ndash;and
then the preparations for war. The memory of
the past faded away and another thought now haunted
his mind, though he never spoke it&ndash;&ndash;when the time
came, would he fight, or would he stay with Lucy and
let Jeff go out alone? It was a question never answered,
but every day he rode out without his gun,
and Creede took that for a sign.</p>
<p>As the Rio Salagua, swollen with winter rains, rose
up like a writhing yellow serpent and cast itself
athwart the land, it drew a line from east to west
which neither sheep nor cattle could cross, and the
cowmen who had lingered about Hidden Water rode
gayly back to their distant ranches, leaving the peaceful
Dos S where Sallie Winship had hung her cherished
lace curtains and Kitty Bonnair and Lucy
Ware had made a home, almost a total wreck. Sheep,
drought, and flood had passed over it in six months&#8217;
time; the pasture fence was down, the corrals were
half dismantled, and the bunk-room looked like a deserted
grading camp. For a week Creede and Hardy
cleaned up and rebuilt, but every day, in spite of his
partner&#8217;s efforts to divert his mind, Jeff grew more
restless and uneasy. Then one lonely evening he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_433' name='page_433'></a>433</span>
went over to the corner where his money was buried
and began to dig.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;the&ndash;&ndash;hell&ndash;&ndash;is the matter with this
place?&#8221; he exclaimed, looking up from his work as if
he expected the roof to drop. &#8220;Ever since Tommy
died it gits on my nerves, bad.&#8221; He rooted out his
tomato can and stuffed a roll of bills carelessly into
his overalls pocket. &#8220;Got any mail to go out?&#8221; he
inquired, coming back to the fire, and Hardy understood
without more words that Jeff was going on another
drunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I might write a letter to the
boss. But how&#8217;re you going to get across the river&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s
running high now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll git across the river, all right,&#8221; grumbled
Creede. &#8220;Born to be hung and ye can&#8217;t git drowned,
as they say. Well, give the boss my best.&#8221; He
paused, frowning gloomily into the fire. &#8220;Say,&#8221; he
said, his voice breaking a little, &#8220;d&#8217;ye ever hear anything
from Miss Bonnair?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Hardy was silent. Then, reading
what was in his partner&#8217;s heart, he answered gently:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word, Jeff.&#8221;</p>
<p>The big cowboy sighed and grinned cynically.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a mighty bad case I had,&#8221; he observed
philosophically. &#8220;But d&#8217;ye know what was the
matter with me? Well, I never tumbled to it till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_434' name='page_434'></a>434</span>
afterward, but it was jest because she was like Sallie&ndash;&ndash;talked
like her and rode like her, straddle, that way.
But I wanter tell you, boy,&#8221; he added mournfully,
&#8220;<i>Sal</i> had a heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sank once more into sombre contemplation,
grumbling as he nursed his wounds, and at last Hardy
asked him a leading question about Sallie Winship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I ever hear from &#8217;er?&#8221; repeated Creede, rousing
up from his reverie. &#8220;No, and it ain&#8217;t no use to
try. I wrote to her three times, but I never got no
answer&ndash;&ndash;I reckon the old lady held &#8217;em out on her.
She wouldn&#8217;t stand for no bow-legged cowpuncher&ndash;&ndash;and
ye can&#8217;t blame her none, the way old man
Winship used to make her cook for them <i>rod&eacute;o</i> hands&ndash;&ndash;but
Sallie would&#8217;ve answered them letters if she&#8217;d
got &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where were they living in St. Louis?&#8221; persisted
Hardy. &#8220;Maybe you got the wrong address.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope, I got it straight&ndash;&ndash;Saint Louie, Mo., jest
the way you see it in these money-order catalogues.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t you give any street and number?&#8221;
cried Hardy, aghast. &#8220;Why, for Heaven&#8217;s sake,
Jeff, there are half a million people in St. Louis&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;d
never get it in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; inquired Creede apathetically. &#8220;Well, it
don&#8217;t make no difference, then. I don&#8217;t amount to a
dam&#8217;, anyhow&ndash;&ndash;and this is no place for a woman&ndash;&ndash;but,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_435' name='page_435'></a>435</span>
by God, Rufe, I do git awful lonely when I see
you writin&#8217; them letters to the boss. If I only had
somebody that cared for me I&#8217;d prize up hell to make
good. I&#8217;d do anything in God&#8217;s world&ndash;&ndash;turn back
them sheep or give up my six-shooter, jest as she said;
but, nope, they&#8217;s no such luck for Jeff Creede&ndash;&ndash;he
couldn&#8217;t make a-winnin&#8217; with a squaw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeff,&#8221; said Hardy quietly, &#8220;how much would you
give to get a letter from Sallie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye mean?&#8221; demanded Creede, looking up
quickly. Then, seeing the twinkle in his partner&#8217;s
eye, he made a grab for his money. &#8220;My whole
wad,&#8221; he cried, throwing down the roll. &#8220;What&#8217;s
the deal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; answered Hardy, deliberately counting
out the bills, &#8220;there&#8217;s the ante&ndash;&ndash;a hundred dollars.
The rest I hold back for that trip to St. Louis.
This hundred goes to the Rinkerton Detective
Agency, St. Louis, Missouri, along with a real nice
letter that I&#8217;ll help you write; and the minute they
deliver that letter into the hands of Miss Sallie Winship,
formerly of Hidden Water, Arizona, and return
an answer, there&#8217;s another hundred coming to &#8217;em.
Is it a go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardner,&#8221; said Creede, rising up solemnly from
his place, &#8220;I want to shake with you on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning, with a package of letters in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_436' name='page_436'></a>436</span>
crown of his black hat, Jefferson Creede swam Bat
Wings across the swift current of the Salagua, hanging
onto his tail from behind, and without even stopping
to pour the water out of his boots struck into
the long trail for Bender.</p>
<p>One week passed, and then another, and at last he
came back, wet and dripping from his tussle with the
river, and cursing the very name of detectives.</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y, shucks!&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;I bummed around
in town there for two weeks, hatin&#8217; myself and makin&#8217;
faces at a passel of ornery sheepmen, and what do I
git for my trouble? &#8216;Dear Mister Creede, your
letter of umpty-ump received. We have detailed
Detective Moriarty on this case and will report later.
Yours truly!&#8217; That&#8217;s all&ndash;&ndash;keep the change&ndash;&ndash;we
make a livin&#8217; off of suckers&ndash;&ndash;and they&#8217;s one born
every minute. To hell with these detectives! Well,
I never received nothin&#8217; more and finally I jumped at
a poor little bandy-legged sheep-herder, a cross between
a gorilla and a Digger Injun&ndash;&ndash;scared him to
death. But I pulled my freight quick before we had
any international complications. Don&#8217;t mention Mr.
Allan Q. Rinkerton to me, boy, or I&#8217;ll throw a fit.
Say,&#8221; he said, changing the subject abruptly, &#8220;how
many hundred thousand sheep d&#8217;ye think I saw,
comin&#8217; up from Bender? Well, sir, they was sheep as
far as the eye could see&ndash;&ndash;millions of &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_437' name='page_437'></a>437</span>
they&#8217;ve got that plain et down to the original sand
and cactus, already. W&#8217;y, boy, if we let them sheepmen
in on us this Spring we&#8217;ll look like a watermelon
patch after a nigger picnic; we&#8217;ll be cleaned like
Pablo Moreno; they won&#8217;t be pickin&#8217;s for a billy
goat! And Jim &#8217;n&#8217; Jasp have been ribbin&#8217; their
herders on scandalous. This little bandy-legged son-of-a-goat
that I jumped at down in Bender actually
had the nerve to say that I killed Juan Alvarez myself.
Think of that, will ye, and me twenty miles
away at the time! But I reckon if you took Jasp to
pieces you&#8217;d find out he was mad over them three
thousand wethers&ndash;&ndash;value six dollars per&ndash;&ndash;that I
stompeded. The dastard! D&#8217;ye see how he keeps
away from me? Well, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to call the <i>rod&eacute;o</i>
right away and work that whole upper range, and
when the river goes down you&#8217;ll find Jeff Creede
right there with the goods if Jasp is lookin&#8217; for
trouble. Read them letters, boy, and tell me if I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to have the old judge on my hands, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the letters, he was; and the boss was
also looking forward with pleasure to her visit in the
Spring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, wouldn&#8217;t that jar you,&#8221; commented Creede,
and then he laughed slyly. &#8220;Cheer up,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it
might be worse&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;s nothin&#8217; said about Kitty
Bonnair.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_438' name='page_438'></a>438</span></div>
<p>Sure enough&ndash;&ndash;not a word about Kitty, and the
year before Lucy had spoken about her in every
letter! There was something mysterious about it,
and sinister; they both felt it.</p>
<p>And when at last the wagon came in, bearing only
Judge Ware and Lucy, somehow even Jeff&#8217;s sore
heart was touched by a sense of loss. But while
others might dissemble, Bill Lightfoot&#8217;s impulsive
nature made no concealment of its chiefest thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Miss Bunnair?&#8221; he demanded, as soon
as Lucy Ware was free, and there was a sudden lull
in the conversation roundabout as the cowboys
listened for the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said Miss Ware, politely evasive, &#8220;but
she wasn&#8217;t able to come with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be down bimeby, though, won&#8217;t she?&#8221; persisted
Lightfoot; and when Lucy finally answered
with a vague &#8220;Perhaps&#8221; he turned to the assembled
cowboys with a triumphant grin. &#8220;Um, now, what&#8217;d
I tell you!&#8221; he said; and one and all they scowled and
stabbed him with their eyes.</p>
<p>The <i>rod&eacute;o</i> camp was already established beneath
the big mesquite, and while three or four careless cowmen
held the day herd over against the mesa the rest
of the outfit was busy raking The Rolls. It was all
very different from what Judge Ware and Lucy had
anticipated. There was no sign of excitement in their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_439' name='page_439'></a>439</span>
midst, no ostentatious display of arms or posting of
patrols, and what surprised the judge most of all
was that in their friendly gatherings around the fire
there was no one, save Hardy, who would argue
against the sheep.</p>
<p>The judge had been on to Washington and was
possessed of all the material facts, but nobody was interested
any more in the Salagua Forest Reserve; he
had consulted with the Chief Forester and even with
the President himself, laying before them the imminence
of the danger, and they had assured him
that everything possible would be done to relieve the
situation. Did it not, then, he demanded, behoove the
law-abiding residents of prospective forest reserves
to co&ouml;perate with such an enlightened administration,
even at the risk of some temporary personal loss?
And with one voice the Four Peaks cowmen agreed
that it did. There was something eerie about it&ndash;&ndash;the
old judge was dazed by their acquiescence.</p>
<p>Of all the cowmen at Hidden Water, Rufus Hardy
was the only man who would discuss the matter at
length. A change had come over him now; he was
very thin and quiet, with set lines along his jaw, but
instead of riding nervously up and down the river as
he had the year before he lingered idly about the
ranch, keeping tally at the branding and entertaining
his guests. No matter how pedantic or polemical the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_440' name='page_440'></a>440</span>
old judge became, Hardy was willing to listen to
him; and Lucy, hovering in the background, would
often smile to hear them argue, the judge laying down
the law and equity of the matter and Rufus meeting
him like an expert swordsman with parry and thrust.
Day by day, his prejudice wearing away from lack of
any real opposition, Judge Ware became more and
more pleased with his daughter&#8217;s superintendent; but
Lucy herself was troubled. There was a look in his
eyes that she had never seen before, a set and haggard
stare that came when he sat alone, and his head was
always turned aside, as if he were listening. The
sheep came trooping in from the south, marching in
long lines to the river&#8217;s edge, and still he sat quiet, just
inside the door, listening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, Rufus,&#8221; she said, one day when her
father was inspecting the upper range with Creede,
&#8220;what is it that made you so sad? Is it&ndash;&ndash;Kitty?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a minute he gazed at her, a faint smile on his
lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, at last, &#8220;it is not Kitty.&#8221; And then
he lapsed back into silence, his head turned as before.</p>
<p>The wind breathed through the <i>corredor</i>, bringing
with it a distant, plaintive bleating&ndash;&ndash;the sheep, waiting
beyond the turbid river to cross.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have forgotten about Kitty,&#8221; he said absently.
&#8220;For me there is nothing in the world but sheep.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_441' name='page_441'></a>441</span>
Can&#8217;t you hear them bleating down there?&#8221; he cried,
throwing out his hands. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you smell them?
Ah, Lucy, if you knew sheep as I do! I never hear a
sheep now that I don&#8217;t think of that day last year
when they came pouring out of Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket
with a noise like the end of the world. If I had been
there to stop them they might never have taken the
range&ndash;&ndash;but after that, all through the hot summer
when the cattle were dying for feed, every time the
wind came up and roared in my ears I would hear
sheep&ndash;&ndash;<i>baaa</i>, <i>baaa</i>&ndash;&ndash;and now I hear them again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and looked up at her intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what that noise means to me?&#8221; he
demanded, almost roughly. &#8220;It means little calves
dying around the water hole; mothers lowing for
their little ones that they have left to starve; it means
long lines of cows following me out over the mesa
for brush, and all the trees cut down. Ah, Lucy, how
can your father talk of waiting when it means as much
as that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But last year was a drought,&#8221; protested Lucy pitifully.
&#8220;Will it be as bad this year?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every bit! Did you notice that plain between
Bender and the river? It will be like that in a week
if we let them cross the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried Lucy, &#8220;then you&ndash;&ndash;do you mean to
turn them back?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_442' name='page_442'></a>442</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The river is very high,&#8221; answered Hardy sombrely.
&#8220;They cannot cross.&#8221; And then as a quail
strikes up leaves and dust to hide her nest, he launched
forth quickly upon a story of the flood.</p>
<p>The Salagua was long in flood that Spring. Day
after day, while the sheep wandered uneasily along
its banks rearing up to strip the last remnants of
browse from the tips of willows and burro bushes, it
rolled ponderously forth from its black-walled gorge
and flowed past the crossing, deep and strong, sucking
evenly into the turbid whirlpool that waited for its
prey. At the first approach of the invaders the unconsidered
zeal of Judge Ware overcame him; he
was for peace, reason, the saner judgment that comes
from wider views and a riper mind, and, fired by the
hope of peaceful truce, he rode furtively along the
river waving a white handkerchief whenever he
saw a sheep-herder, and motioning him to cross.
But however anxious he was for an interview the
desires of the sheepmen did not lean in that direction,
and they only stared at him stolidly or
pretended not to see.</p>
<p>Thwarted in his efforts for peace the judge returned
to camp deep in thought. The sheep were at
his very door and nothing had been done to stay
them; a deadly apathy seemed to have settled down
upon the cowmen; after all their threats there were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_443' name='page_443'></a>443</span>
no preparations for defence; the river was not even
patrolled; and yet if quick action was not taken the
upper range might be irreparably ruined before the
reserve was proclaimed. Not that he would countenance
violence, but a judicious show of resistance, for
instance, might easily delay the crossing until the
President could act, or even so daunt the invaders
that they would go around. It was not strictly legal,
of course, but the judge could see no harm in suggesting
it, and as soon as the cowmen were gathered
about their fire that evening he went out and sat
down by Creede, who lay sprawled on his back, his
head pillowed on his hands, smoking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Jefferson,&#8221; he began, feeling his way cautiously,
&#8220;I see that the sheep have come down to
the river&ndash;&ndash;they will be making a crossing soon, I
suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>Creede sucked studiously upon his cigarette, and
shifted it to a corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y yes, Judge,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I reckon they will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;do you think they intend to invade
our upper range this year?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; responded Creede, resuming his
smoke, &#8220;that&#8217;s what they come up here for. You
want to take a last long look at this grass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but, Jefferson,&#8221; protested the judge, opening
up his eyes, &#8220;what will our cattle feed upon then?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_444' name='page_444'></a>444</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Same old thing,&#8221; answered Creede, &#8220;<i>palo verde</i>
and giant cactus. I&#8217;ve got most of mine in the town
herd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Judge Ware, astounded at the
suggestion, &#8220;you don&#8217;t mean to say that you are preparing
to go out of business? Why, my dear Jefferson,
this country may be set aside as a forest reserve
at any minute&ndash;&ndash;and think of the privileges you will
be giving up! As an owner of cattle already grazing
upon the range you will be entitled to the first consideration
of the Government; you will be granted
the first grazing permit; there will be forest rangers
to protect you; the sheep, being transient stock and
known to be very destructive to forest growth, will
undoubtedly be confined to a narrow trail far below
us; by the payment of a nominal grazing fee you
will be absolutely guaranteed in all your rights and
watched over by the Federal Government!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hell!&#8221; exclaimed the big cowboy, rising up
suddenly from his place, &#8220;don&#8217;t talk Government to
me, whatever you do! W&#8217;y, Judge,&#8221; he cried, throwing
out his hands, &#8220;they ain&#8217;t no Government here.
They ain&#8217;t no law. I could go over and kill one of
them sheep-herders and you wouldn&#8217;t see an officer
in two days. I&#8217;ve lived here for nigh onto twenty-six
years and the nearest I ever come to seein&#8217; the
Government was a mule branded &#8216;U. S.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_445' name='page_445'></a>445</span></div>
<p>He stopped abruptly and, striding out into the
darkness, picked up a log of wood and laid it carefully
upon the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judge,&#8221; he said, turning suddenly and wagging
an accusing finger at his former employer, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
heard a lot from you about this reserve, how the
President was goin&#8217; to telegraph you the news the
minute he signed the proclamation, and send a ranger
in to protect the range, and all that, but I ain&#8217;t seen
you <i>do</i> nothin&#8217;! Now if you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to make good
you&#8217;ve got jest about three days to do it in&ndash;&ndash;after
that the sheep will have us dished. Maybe you could
use your pull to kinder hurry things up a little&ndash;&ndash;do
a little telegraphin&#8217;, or somethin&#8217; like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; cried the judge, taking the bait like
a fish, &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it at once! I want your best horse,
Jeff, and a guide. I&#8217;ll wire the chief forester from
Bender!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keno!&#8221; said Creede sententiously, &#8220;and give my
regards to Teddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the old judge disappeared over the western rim
the next morning the <i>rod&eacute;o</i> boss smiled grimly behind
his hand, and glanced significantly at Hardy. Then,
with the outfit behind him, he rode slowly up the
ca&ntilde;on, leaving his partner to his steady job as &#8220;family
man&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;entertaining the boss.</p>
<p>For two days the sheepmen watched the river
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_446' name='page_446'></a>446</span>
eagerly, waiting for a drop; then suddenly, as the
snow water ran by and a cool day checked the distant
streams, it fell, and the swift pageant of the crossing
began. At sun-up a boss herder rode boldly out into
the current and swam it with his horse; brawny Mexicans
leapt into the thicket of <i>palo verdes</i> that grew
against the cliff and cut branches to build a chute;
Jasper Swope in his high sombrero and mounted on
his black mule galloped down from the hidden camp
and urged his men along. Still the same ominous
silence hung about the shore where Juan Alvarez lay
buried beneath the cross. There was no watcher on
Lookout Point, no horsemen lurking in the distance;
only the lowing of the day herd, far up the ca&ntilde;on,
and the lapping of muddy waters. Across the river
the low <i>malpai</i> cliffs rose up like ramparts against
them and Black Butte frowned down upon them like
a watch tower, but of the men who might be there
watching there was no sign.</p>
<p>The sheepman studied upon the situation for a
while; then he sent a messenger flying back to camp
and soon a hardy band of wethers came down, led by
an advance guard of goats, and their plaintive bleating
echoed in a confused chorus from the high cliffs as
they entered the wings of the chute. Already the
camp rustlers had driven them out on the slanting
rock and encircled the first cut with their canvas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_447' name='page_447'></a>447</span>
wagon cover, when Jasper Swope held up his hand
for them to stop. At the last moment and for no
cause he hesitated, touched by some premonition, or
suspicious of the silent shore. One after another
the herders clambered back and squatted idly against
the cool cliff, smoking and dangling their polished
carbines; the sheep, left standing upon the rock, huddled
together and stood motionless; the goats leapt
nimbly up on adjacent bowlders and gazed across the
river intently; then, throwing up his hand again,
the sheepman spurred his black mule recklessly
into the water, waving his big hat as he motioned for
the sheep to cross.</p>
<p>As the long hours of that portentous morning wore
on, palpitating to the clamor of the sheep, a great
quiet settled upon Hidden Water. Sitting just within
the door Hardy watched Lucy as she went about
her work, but his eyes were wandering and haggard
and he glanced from time to time at the Black Butte
that stood like a sentinel against the crossing. In
the intervals of conversation the bleating of the sheep
rose suddenly from down by the river, and ceased; he
talked on, feverishly, never stopping for an answer,
and Lucy looked at him strangely, as if wondering
at his preoccupation. Again the deep tremolo rose
up, echoing from the cliffs, and Hardy paused in the
midst of a story to listen. He was still staring out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_448' name='page_448'></a>448</span>
the doorway when Lucy Ware came over and laid her
hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rufus,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what is it you are always listening
for? Day after day I see you watching here by
the door, and when I talk you listen for something
else. Tell me&ndash;&ndash;is it&ndash;&ndash;are you watching for Kitty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kitty?&#8221; repeated Hardy, his eyes still intent.
&#8220;Why no; why should I be watching for her?&#8221;</p>
<p>At his answer, spoken so impassively, she drew
away quickly, but he caught her hand and stopped
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah no,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if I could only listen for something
else it would be better&ndash;&ndash;but all I hear is sheep.
I&#8217;m like old Bill Johnson; I can still shoot straight
and find my way in the mountains, but every time I
hear a sheep blat I change. Poor old Bill, he&#8217;s over
across the river there now; the boys have heard his
hounds baying up in the high cliffs for a week. I&#8217;ve
seen him a time or two since he took to the hills and
he&#8217;s just as quiet and gentle with me as if he were
my father, but if anybody mentions sheep he goes
raving crazy in a minute. Jeff says he&#8217;s been that
way himself for years, and now it&#8217;s got me, too. If
I get much worse,&#8221; he ended, suddenly glancing up at
her with a wistful smile, &#8220;you&#8217;ll have to take me
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Away!&#8221; cried Lucy eagerly, &#8220;would you go?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_449' name='page_449'></a>449</span>
You know father and I have talked of it time and
again, but you just stick and stick, and nothing will
make you leave. But listen&ndash;&ndash;what was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>A succession of rifle shots, like the popping of wet
logs over a fire, came dully to their ears, muffled by
the bleating of sheep and the echoing of the cliffs.
Hardy leapt to his feet and listened intently, his eyes
burning with suppressed excitement; then he stepped
reluctantly back into the house and resumed his seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s only those Mexican herders,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;They shoot that way to drive their sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But look!&#8221; cried Lucy, pointing out the door, &#8220;the
Black Butte is afire! Just see that great smoke!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardy sprang up again and dashed out into the
open. The popping of thirty-thirtys had ceased, but
from the summit of the square-topped butte a signal
fire rose up to heaven, tall and straight and black.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; he muttered, and without looking at her he
ran out to the corral to saddle Chapuli. But when he
came back he rode slowly, checking the impatience of
his horse, until at last he dismounted beside her. For
days his eyes had been furtive and evasive, but now at
last they were steady.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been very honest with
you, but I guess you know what this means&ndash;&ndash;the
boys are turning back the sheep.&#8221; His voice was low
and gentle, and he stood very straight before her, like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_450' name='page_450'></a>450</span>
a soldier. Yet, even though she sensed what was in
his mind, Lucy smiled. For a month he had been
to her like another man, a man without emotion or
human thought, and now in a moment he had come
back, the old Rufus that she had known in her heart
so long.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, holding out her hand to him, &#8220;I
knew it. But you are working for me, you know, and
I cannot let you go. Listen, Rufus,&#8221; she pleaded,
as he drew away, &#8220;have I ever refused you anything?
Tell me what you want to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go down there and help turn back those
sheep,&#8221; he said, bluntly. &#8220;You know me, Lucy&ndash;&ndash;my
heart is in this fight&ndash;&ndash;my friends are in it&ndash;&ndash;and
I must go.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waited for some answer, but Lucy only turned
away. There were tears in her eyes when she looked
back at him and her lips trembled, but she passed into
the house without a word. Hardy gazed wonderingly
after her and his heart smote him; she was like some
sensitive little child to whom every rough word was a
blow, and he had hurt her. He glanced at the signal
fire that rolled up black and sombre as the watcher
piled green brush upon it, then he dropped his bridle
rein and stepped quickly into the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must forgive me, Lucy,&#8221; he said, standing
humbly at the door. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I am changed. But do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_451' name='page_451'></a>451</span>
not think that I will come to any harm&ndash;&ndash;this is not
a battle against men, but sheep. No one will be
killed. And now may I go?&#8221; Once more his voice
became low and gentle and he stood before her like
some questing knight before his queen, but she only
sat gazing at him with eyes that he could not understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Lucy,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I will not go unless you
tell me&ndash;&ndash;and now may I go?&#8221;</p>
<p>A smile came over Lucy&#8217;s face but she did not speak
her thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will stay for my sake,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I shall be
very happy, but I will not hold you against your
will. Oh, Rufus, Rufus!&#8221; she cried, suddenly holding
out her hands, &#8220;can&#8217;t you understand? I can&#8217;t
set myself against you, and yet&ndash;&ndash;think what it is to
be a woman!&#8221; She rose up and stood before him, the
soft light glowing in her eyes, and Hardy stepped forward
to meet her; but in that moment a drumming of
hoofs echoed through the doorway, there was a rush of
horsemen leaning forward as they rode, and then Jefferson
Creede thundered by, glancing back as he
spurred down the ca&ntilde;on to meet the sheep.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; whispered Hardy, following his flight
with startled eyes, and as the rout of cowboys flashed
up over the top of Lookout Point and were gone he
bowed his head in silence.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_452' name='page_452'></a>452</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Lucy,&#8221; he said, at last, &#8220;my mind has been far
away. I&ndash;&ndash;I have not seen what was before me, and
I shall always be the loser. But look&ndash;&ndash;I have two
friends in all the world, you and Jeff, and you are
the dearer by far. But you could see as Jeff went
by that he was mad. What he will do at the river I
can only guess; he is crazy, and a crazy man will do
anything. But if I am with him I can hold him back&ndash;&ndash;will
you let me go?&#8221; He held out his hands and
as Lucy took them she saw for the first time in his shy
eyes&ndash;&ndash;love. For a moment she gazed at him wistfully,
but her heart never faltered. Whatever his will
might be she would never oppose it, now that she had
his love.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Rufus,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you may go, but remember&ndash;&ndash;me.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE LAST CROSSING</h3>
</div>
<p>The rush and thunder of cow ponies as they hammered
over the trail and plunged down through
the rocks and trees had hardly lost its echoes in the
cliffs when, with a flash of color and a dainty pattering
of hoofs, Chapuli came flying over the top of
Lookout Point and dashed up the river after them.
The cowmen had left their horses in the deep ravine
at the end of the <i>malpai</i> bluffs and were already
crouched behind the rampart of the rim rocks as close
as Indian fighters, each by some loophole in the blackened
<i>malpai</i>, with a rifle in his hand. As Hardy crept
in from behind, Jeff Creede motioned him to a place at
his side greeting him at the same time with a broad
grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, sport,&#8221; he said, &#8220;couldn&#8217;t keep out of it,
eh? Well, we need ye, all right. Here, you can hold
straighter than I can; take my gun and shoot rainbows
around the leaders when they start to come across.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; answered Hardy, waving the gun
away, &#8220;I just came down to keep you out of trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-es!&#8221; jeered Creede, &#8220;first thing I know you&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_454' name='page_454'></a>454</span>
be down there fightin&#8217; &#8217;em back with rocks. But
say,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;d&#8217;ye notice anything funny up on
that cliff? Listen, now!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardy turned his head, and soon above the clamor
of the sheep he made out the faint &#8220;<i>Owwp! Owwwp!</i>&#8221;
of hounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Bill Johnson, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he said, and Creede
nodded significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;God help them pore sheepmen,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;if
Bill has got his thirty-thirty. Listen to &#8217;em sing, will
ye! Ain&#8217;t they happy, though? And they don&#8217;t give
a dam&#8217; for us&ndash;&ndash;ump-um&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;re comin&#8217; across
anyway. Well, that&#8217;s what keeps hell crowded&ndash;&ndash;let
&#8217;er go!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a glitter of carbines against the opposite
cliffs where the spare herders had taken to cover, but
out on the rocky point where the chute led into the
river a gang of Mexicans and two Americans were
leading their wagon cover around a fresh cut of goats
and sheep. On the sand bar far below the stragglers
from the first cut, turned back in the initial rush,
were wandering aimlessly about or plodding back to
the herd, but the sheepmen with bullheaded persistence
were preparing to try again. Chief among them
towered the boss, Jasper Swope, wet to the waist from
swimming across the river; and as he motioned to the
herders to go ahead he ran back and mounted his mule
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_455' name='page_455'></a>455</span>
again. With a barbaric shout the Mexicans surged
forward on the tarpaulin, sweeping their cut to the
very edge; then, as the goats set their feet and held
back, a swarthy herder leapt into the midst and
tumbled them, sheep and goats alike, into the water.
Like plummets they went down into the slow-moving
depths, some headfirst, some falling awkwardly on
their backs or slipping like beavers on a slide; there
was a prolonged and mighty splash and then, one by
one the heads bobbed up and floated away until, led by
the high-horned goats, they struck out for the opposite
shore. Below, yelling and throwing stones to
frighten them, a line of Mexicans danced up and down
along the rocky shore, and to keep them from drifting
into the whirlpool Jasper Swope plunged boldly into
the water on his mule.</p>
<p>Sink or swim, the sheep were in the water, and for a
minute there was a tense silence along the river; then,
as the goats lined out, a rifle shot echoed from the
cliffs and a white column of water rose up before the
leader. He shook his head, hesitated and looked
back, and once more the water splashed in his face,
while the deep <i>ploomp</i> of the bullet answered to the
shot. Fighting away from the sudden stroke the goat
lost his headway and, drifting, fouled those below
him; a sudden confusion fell upon the orderly ranks
of the invaders and, like a flock of geese whose leader
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_456' name='page_456'></a>456</span>
is killed, they jostled against one another, some intent
on the farther shore and some struggling to turn back.
Instantly a chorus of savage shouts rose up from
along the river, the shrill yells of the cowboys mingling
with the whooping and whistling of the sheepmen,
until at last, overcome by the hostile clamor, the
timid sheep turned back toward the main herd, drawing
with them the goats. For a minute Jasper Swope
fought against them, waving his hat and shouting;
then, rather than see them drift too far and be drawn
into the clutch of the whirlpool, he whipped his mule
about and led them back to the shore.</p>
<p>A second time, calling out all his men to help, the
boss sheepman tried to cross the goats alone, intending
to hold them on the shore for a lure; but just as
they were well lined out the same careful marksman
behind the <i>malpai</i> threw water in their faces and
turned them back. But this time Jasper Swope did
not lead the retreat. Slapping his black mule over
the ears with his hat he held straight for the opposite
shore, cursing and brandishing his gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dam&#8217;, cowardly passel of tail-twisters!&#8221; he
cried, shaking his fist at the bluffs, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you
come out into the open like men?&#8221;</p>
<p>But a grim silence was his only answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, you bold bad man from Bitter Creek,
Texas!&#8221; he shouted, riding closer to the beach. &#8220;Why
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_457' name='page_457'></a>457</span>
don&#8217;t you come down and fight me like a man?&#8221; His
big voice was trembling with excitement and he held
his pistol balanced in the air as if awaiting an attack,
but Jefferson Creede did not answer him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fight you, man to man, you big blowhard!&#8221;
thundered Swope, &#8220;and there goes my pistol to prove
it!&#8221; He rose in his stirrups as he spoke and hurled
it away from him, throwing his cartridge belt after it.
&#8220;<i>Now</i>,&#8221; he yelled, &#8220;you&#8217;ve been sayin&#8217; what you&#8217;d
do; come out of your hole, Jeff Creede, I want ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you won&#8217;t git me, then,&#8221; answered Creede,
his voice coming cold and impassive from over the rim.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll fight you some other time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahrr!&#8221; taunted Swope, &#8220;hear the coward talk!
Here I stand, unarmed, and he&#8217;s afraid to come out!
But if there&#8217;s a man amongst you, send him down,
and if he licks me I&#8217;ll go around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go around anyhow, you Mormon-faced
wool-puller!&#8221; replied the cowman promptly, &#8220;and
we&#8217;re here to see to it, so you might as well chase
yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I like this side,&#8221; said the sheepman, pretending
to admire the scenery. &#8220;I&#8217;ll jest stay here a while,
and then I&#8217;ll cross in spite of ye. If I can&#8217;t cross
here,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I&#8217;ll wait for the river to fall and
cross down below&ndash;&ndash;and then I&#8217;ll sheep you to the
rocks, you low-lived, skulkin&#8217; murderers! It&#8217;s a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_458' name='page_458'></a>458</span>
wonder some of you don&#8217;t shoot <i>me</i> the way you did
Juan Alvarez, down there.&#8221; He waved his hand
toward the point where the wooden cross rose against
the sky, but no one answered the taunt.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Murderers</i>, I said!&#8221; he shouted, rising up in his
saddle. &#8220;I call you murderers before God A&#8217;mighty
and there ain&#8217;t a man denies it! Oh, my Mexicans
can see that cross&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;re lookin&#8217; at it now&ndash;&ndash;and
when the river goes down they&#8217;ll come in on you, if
it&#8217;s only to break even for Juan.&#8221;</p>
<p>He settled back in his saddle and gazed doubtfully
at the bluff, and then at the opposite shore. Nature
had placed him at a disadvantage, for the river was
wide and deep and his sheep were easy to turn, yet
there was still a chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he began, moderating his voice to a more
conciliatory key, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do. There&#8217;s
no use shooting each other over this. Send down
your best man&ndash;&ndash;if he licks me I go around; if I
lick him I come across. Is it a go?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a short silence and then an argument
broke out along the bluff, a rapid fire of exhortation
and protest, some urging Creede to take him up, others
clamoring for peace.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; shouted Jefferson Creede, raising his voice
angrily above the uproar. &#8220;I won&#8217;t do it! I
wouldn&#8217;t trust a sheepman as far as I could throw a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_459' name='page_459'></a>459</span>
bull by the tail! You&#8217;d sell your black soul for two
bits, Jasp Swope,&#8221; he observed, peering warily over
the top of the rock, &#8220;and you&#8217;d shoot a man in the
back, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But look at me!&#8221; cried Swope, dropping off his
mule, &#8220;I&#8217;m stripped to my shirt; there goes my gun
into the water&ndash;&ndash;and I&#8217;m on your side of the river!
You&#8217;re a coward, Jeff Creede, and I always knowed
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But my head ain&#8217;t touched,&#8221; commented Creede
dryly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got you stopped anyhow. What kind
of a dam&#8217; fool would I be to fight over it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fight ye for nothin&#8217;, then!&#8221; bellowed the sheepman.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He stopped abruptly and a great
quiet fell upon both shores. From the mouth of
the hidden ravine a man had suddenly stepped
into the open, unarmed, and now he was coming out
across the sands to meet him. It was Rufus Hardy,
dwarfed like David before Goliath in the presence of
the burly sheepman, but striding over the hard-packed
sand with the lithe swiftness of a panther.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I&#8217;ll</i> fight you,&#8221; he said, raising his hand in challenge,
but Swope&#8217;s answer was drowned in a wild yell
from Creede.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back here, Rufe, you durn&#8217; fool!&#8221; he called.
&#8220;Come back, I tell ye! Don&#8217;t you know better than
to trust a sheepman?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_460' name='page_460'></a>460</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, now,&#8221; answered Hardy, turning austerely
to the bluff. &#8220;I guess I can take care of myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He swung about and advanced to the stretch of level
sand where Swope was standing. &#8220;What guarantee
do I get,&#8221; he demanded sharply, &#8220;that if I lick you in
a fair fight the sheep will go around?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;lick&ndash;&ndash;me!&#8221; repeated the sheepman, showing
his jagged teeth in a sardonic grin. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll
tell ye, Willie; if you hit me with that lily-white hand
of yourn, and I find it out the same day, I&#8217;ll promise
to stay off&#8217;n your range for a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied Hardy, suddenly throwing
away his hat. &#8220;You noticed it when I hit you before,
didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; he inquired, edging quickly in on his
opponent and beginning an amazing bout of shadow
boxing. &#8220;Well, <i>come on</i>, <i>then</i>!&#8221; He laughed as
Swope struck out at him, and continued his hectoring
banter. &#8220;As I remember it your head hit the ground
before your heels!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then in a whirlwind of blows and feints they came
together. It was the old story of science against
brute strength. Jasper Swope was a rough-and-tumble
fighter of note; he was quick, too, in spite of his
weight, and his blows were like the strokes of a sledge;
but Hardy did not attempt to stand up against him.
For the first few minutes it was more of a chase than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_461' name='page_461'></a>461</span>
a fight, and in that the sheepman was at his worst,
cumbered by his wet clothes and the water in his shoes.
Time and again he rushed in upon his crouching opponent,
who always seemed in the act of delivering a
blow and yet at the moment only sidestepped and
danced away. The hard wet sand was ploughed and
trampled with their tracks, the records of a dozen useless
plunges, when suddenly instead of dodging Hardy
stepped quickly forward, his &#8220;lily-white hand&#8221; shot
out, and Jasper Swope&#8217;s head went back with a jerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;You son-of-a-goat!&#8221; he yelled, as the blood ran
down his face, and lowering his head he bored in upon
Hardy furiously. Once more Hardy sidestepped,
but the moment his enemy turned he flew at him like a
tiger, raining blows upon his bloody face in lightning
succession.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Huh</i>!&#8221; grunted the sheepman, coughing like a
wood-chopper as he struck back through the storm,
and the chance blow found its mark. For a moment
Hardy staggered, clutching at his chest; but as Swope
sprang forward to finish his work he ducked and
slipped aside, stumbling like a man about to drop.</p>
<p>A shrill yell went up from the farther shore as
Hardy stood swaying in his tracks, and a fierce shout
of warning from the bluff; but Jasper Swope was implacable.
Brushing the blood from his eyes he
stepped deliberately forward and aimed a blow that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_462' name='page_462'></a>462</span>
would have felled an ox, straight at his enemy&#8217;s head.
It missed; the drooping head snapped down like Judy
before Punch and rose up again, truculently; then
before the sheepman could regain his balance Hardy
threw his whole strength into a fierce uppercut that
laid Swope sprawling on his back.</p>
<p>A howl of triumph and derision rose up from the
rim of the bluff as the burly sheepman went down, but
it changed to a sudden shout of warning as he
scrambled back to his feet again. There was something
indescribably vengeful about him as he whirled
upon his enemy, and his hand went inside his torn shirt
in a gesture not to be mistaken.</p>

Threw the sand full in his face<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Look out there, Rufe!&#8221; yelled Creede, leaping up
from behind his rock pile. &#8220;Run! <i>Jump into the
river</i>!&#8221; But instead Hardy grabbed up a handful of
sand and ran in upon his adversary. The pistol stuck
for a moment in its hidden sling and as Swope
wrenched it loose and turned to shoot, Hardy made as
if to close with him and then threw the sand full in
his face. It was only an instant&#8217;s respite but as the
sheepman blinked and struck the dirt from his eyes the
little cowman wheeled and made a dash for the river.
&#8220;<i>Look out</i>!&#8221; screamed Creede, as the gun flashed out
and came to a point, and like a bullfrog Hardy hurled
himself far out into the eddying water. Then like the
sudden voice of Nemesis, protesting against such
treachery, a rifle shot rang out from the towering
crags that overshadowed the river and Jasper Swope
fell forward, dead. His pistol smashed against a rock
and exploded, but the man he had set himself to kill
was already buried beneath the turbid waters. So
swiftly did it all happen that no two men saw the
same&ndash;&ndash;some were still gazing at the body of Jasper
Swope; others were staring up at the high cliff whence
the shot had come; but Jeff Creede had eyes only for
the river and when he saw Hardy&#8217;s head bob up, halfway
to the whirlpool, and duck again to escape the
bullets, he leapt up and ran for his horse. Then Bill
Johnson&#8217;s rifle rang out again from the summit of his
high cliff, and every man scrambled for cover.</p>
<p>A Mexican herder dropped his gun suddenly and
slipped down behind a rock; and his <i>compadres</i>, not
knowing from whence the hostile fire came, pushed out
their carbines and began to shoot wildly; the deep
ca&ntilde;on reverberated to the rattle of thirty-thirtys and
the steady <i>crack</i>, <i>crack</i> of the rifle above threw the
sheep camp into confusion. There was a shout as
Creede dashed recklessly out into the open and the
sand leapt up in showers behind him, but Bat Wings
was running like the wind and the bullets went wide
of their mark.</p>
<p>Swinging beneath the mesquite trees and scrambling
madly over stones and bushes he hammered up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_463' name='page_463'></a>463</span>
slope of Lookout Point and disappeared in a cloud of
dirt, but as Hardy drifted around the bend and floated
toward the whirlpool there was a crash of brush from
down the river and Creede came battering through the
trees to the shore. Taking down his <i>reata</i> as he rode
he leapt quickly off his horse and ran out on the big
flat rock from which they had often fished together.
At his feet the turbid current rolled ponderously
against the solid wall of rock and, turning back upon
itself, swung round in an ever-lessening circle until it
sucked down suddenly into a spiral vortex that
spewed up all it caught in the boiling channel below.
There in years past the lambs and weaklings from
the herds above had drifted to their death, but never
before had the maelstrom claimed a man.</p>
<p>Swimming weakly with the current Hardy made a
last ineffectual effort to gain the bank; then fixing
his eyes upon his partner he resigned himself to the
drag of the whirlpool, staking his life on a single throw
of the rope. Once the plaited rawhide was wetted
it would twist and bind in the <i>honda</i> and before Creede
could beat it straight and coil it his partner would
be far out in the centre of the vortex. Planting his
feet firmly on the rock the big cowboy lashed the kinks
out of his <i>reata</i> and coiled it carefully; then as the
first broad swirl seized its plaything and swung him
slowly around Creede let out a big loop and began to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_464' name='page_464'></a>464</span>
swing it about his head, his teeth showing in a tense
grin as he fixed his eyes upon the mark. At each turn
his wrist flexed and his back swayed with a willowy
suppleness but except for that he was like a herculean
statue planted upon the point.</p>
<p>The maelstrom heaved and rocked as it swung its
victim nearer and like a thing with life seemed suddenly
to hurry him past; then as Hardy cried out and
held up a hand for help the rope cut through the air
like a knife and the loop shot far out across the boiling
water. It was a long throw, fifty feet from the rock,
and the last coil had left his tense fingers before the
noose fell, but it splashed a circle clean and true about
the uplifted hand. For a moment the cowboy waited,
watching; then as the heavy rope sank behind his
partner&#8217;s shoulders he took in his slack with a jerk.
The noose tightened beneath Hardy&#8217;s arms and held
him against the insistent tug of the river; and while
the whirlpool roared and foamed against his body
Creede hauled him forth roughly, until, stooping
down, he gathered him into his arms like a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God, boy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;re takin&#8217; big chances,
for a family man&ndash;&ndash;but say, what did I tell you about
sheepmen?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The Mexicans were still firing random shots along
the river when Creede lifted his partner up on Bat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_465' name='page_465'></a>465</span>
Wings and carried him back to Hidden Water.
Long before they reached the house they could see
Lucy standing in the doorway, and Hardy held himself
painfully erect in the saddle, with Creede steadying
him from behind; but when Bat Wings halted
before the <i>ramada</i> Jeff broke rudely in on the play
acting by taking the little man in his arms and depositing
him on a bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fell into the river,&#8221; he said, turning with a reassuring
smile to Lucy, &#8220;but he ain&#8217;t hurt none&ndash;&ndash;only
kinder weak, you know. I reckon a little hot tea
would help some, bein&#8217; as we&#8217;re out of whiskey, and
while you&#8217;re brewin&#8217; it I&#8217;ll git these wet clothes off.
Yes&#8217;m, we&#8217;re havin&#8217; a little trouble, but that&#8217;s only
them locoed Mexicans shootin&#8217; off their spare ammunition.&#8221;
He dragged up a cot as he spoke and was hurriedly
arranging a bed when Lucy interposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but don&#8217;t leave him out here!&#8221; she protested,
&#8220;put him back in his own room, where I can take care
of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Creede, and picking him up from
his bare cot beneath the <i>ramada</i> he carried Hardy into
the little room where he had lived before Lucy Ware
came. &#8220;I guess your troubles are over for a while,
pardner,&#8221; he remarked, as he tucked him into the clean
white bed, and then with a wise look at Lucy he
slipped discreetly out the door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_466' name='page_466'></a>466</span></div>
<p>As she entered with the tea Hardy was lying very
limp and white against the pillow, but after the hot
drink he opened his big gray eyes and looked up at her
sombrely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he said, speaking with elaborate exactness,
&#8220;I want to tell you something.&#8221; He reached
out and took her hand, and as he talked he clung to it
appealingly. &#8220;Lucy,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t forget
about you when I went down there, but&ndash;&ndash;well, when
Jasper Swope came out and challenged us my hair began
to bristle like a dog&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;and the next thing I knew
I was fighting. He said if I licked him he&#8217;d go
round&ndash;&ndash;but you can&#8217;t trust these sheepmen. When
he saw he was whipped he tried to shoot me, and I
had to jump into the river. Oh, I&#8217;m all right now,
but&ndash;&ndash;listen, Lucy!&#8221; He drew her down to him, insistently.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you forgive me, this time?&#8221; he whispered,
and when she nodded he closed his heavy eyes
and fell asleep.</p>
<p>When he awoke in the morning there was nothing
to show for his fierce fight with Swope or his battle
with the river&ndash;&ndash;nothing but a great weariness and a
wistful look in his eyes. But all day while the boys
rode back and forth from the river he lay in bed, looking
dreamily out through the barred window or following
Lucy with furtive glances as she flitted in and
out. Whenever she came near he smiled, and often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_467' name='page_467'></a>467</span>
the soft light crept into his eyes, but when by chance
he touched her hand or she brushed back his hair a
great quiet settled upon him and he turned his face
away.</p>
<p>It was Creede who first took notice of his preoccupation
and after a series of unsatisfactory visits he
beckoned Lucy outside the door with a solemn jerk of
the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that boy&#8217;s got something on his
mind&ndash;&ndash;I can tell by them big eyes of his. Any idee
what it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; answered Lucy, blushing before his
searching gaze, &#8220;unless it&#8217;s the sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; said Creede, &#8220;it ain&#8217;t that. I tried to talk
sheep and he wouldn&#8217;t listen to me. This here looks
kinder bad,&#8221; he observed, shaking his head ominously.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it&ndash;&ndash;layin&#8217; in bed all day and thinkin&#8217;
that way. W&#8217;y, that&#8217;d make <i>me</i> sick!&#8221;</p>
<p>He edged awkwardly over to where she was standing
and lowered his voice confidentially.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, Miss Lucy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve known
Rufe a long time now, and he&#8217;s awful close-mouthed.
He&#8217;s always thinkin&#8217; about something away off
yonder, too&ndash;&ndash;but this is different. Now of course I
don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217; about it, but I think all that boy
needs is a little babyin&#8217;, to make him fergit his troubles.
Yes&#8217;m, that boy&#8217;s lonely. Bein&#8217; sick this way has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_468' name='page_468'></a>468</span>
took the heart out of &#8217;im and made &#8217;im sorry for himself,
like a kid that wants his mother. And so&ndash;&ndash;well,&#8221;
he said, turning abruptly away, &#8220;that&#8217;s all,
jest thought I&#8217;d tell you.&#8221; He pulled down his hat,
swung dexterously up on Bat Wings and galloped
away down the valley, waving his hand at the barred
window as he passed.</p>
<p>Long after the clatter of hoofs had ceased Lucy
stood in the shade of the <i>ramada</i>, gazing pensively at
the fire-blasted buttes and the tender blue mountains
beyond. How could such rugged hillsides produce
men who were always gentle, men whose first
thought was always of those who loved them and
never of fighting and blood? It was a land of hardships
and strife and it left its mark on them all. The
Rufus that she had known before had seemed different
from all other men, and she had loved him for it,
even when all his thought was for Kitty; but now
in two short years he had become stern and headstrong
in his ways; his eyes that had smiled up at her so wistfully
when he had first come back from the river were
set and steady again like a soldier&#8217;s, and he lay brooding
upon some hidden thing that his lips would never
speak. Her mutinous heart went out to him at every
breath, now that he lay there so still; at a word she
could kneel at his side and own that she had always
loved him; but his mind was far away and he took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_469' name='page_469'></a>469</span>
no thought of her weakness. He was silent&ndash;&ndash;and she
must be a woman to the end, a voiceless suppliant,
a slave that waits, unbidden, a chip on the tide that
carries it to some safe haven or hurries it out to sea.</p>
<p>With downcast eyes she turned back into the house,
going about her work with the quiet of a lover who
listens for some call, and as she passed to and fro she
felt his gaze upon her. At last she looked up and
when she met his glance she went in and stood beside
his bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it you want, Rufus?&#8221; she asked, and his
face lit up suddenly as he answered with his eloquent
eyes, but he could not speak the word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who am I?&#8221; he murmured, musingly, &#8220;to ask
for all the world?&#8221; But he held close to the little
hands and as he felt their yielding his breath came
hard and he gazed up at her with infinite tenderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Lucy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you do not know me. I
am a coward&ndash;&ndash;it was born in me&ndash;&ndash;I cannot help it.
Not with men!&#8221; he cried, his eyes lighting up.
&#8220;Ah, no; my father was a soldier, and I can fight&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and his vehemence died away suddenly.
&#8220;Lucy,&#8221; he began again, still clinging to
her hands for courage, &#8220;you have never laughed at
me&ndash;&ndash;you have always been gentle and patient&ndash;&ndash;I
will tell you something. You know how I ran away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_470' name='page_470'></a>470</span>
from Kitty, and how when she came down here I
avoided her. I was afraid, Lucy, and yet&ndash;&ndash;well,
it is all over now.&#8221; He sighed and turned restlessly
on his pillow. &#8220;One day I met her up the river and
she&ndash;&ndash;she called me a coward. Not by the word&ndash;&ndash;but
I knew. That was the day before the sheep came
in through Hell&#8217;s Hip Pocket, and even Jeff doesn&#8217;t
know of the fights I had that night. I went out yesterday
and fought Jasper Swope with my bare hands
to wipe the shame away&ndash;&ndash;but it&#8217;s no use, I&#8217;m a
coward yet.&#8221; He groaned and turned his face to the
wall but Lucy only sighed and brushed back his hair.
For a minute he lay there, tense and still; then as
her hand soothed him he turned and his voice became
suddenly soft and caressing, as she had always
liked it best.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t laugh at me for it, Lucy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I love
you&ndash;&ndash;but I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221; He caught her hands again,
gazing up wistfully into her eyes, and when she
smiled through her tears he drew her nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucy,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;you will understand me.
I have never kissed any one since my mother died&ndash;&ndash;could&ndash;&ndash;could
you kiss me first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, Rufus,&#8221; she answered, and as their lips
met he held her gently in his arms.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE END OF IT ALL</h3>
</div>
<p>There is a mocking-bird at Hidden Water that
sings the songs of all the birds and whistles for
the dog. His nest is in a great cluster of mistletoe
in the mesquite tree behind the house and every morning
he polishes his long curved bill against the
<i>ramada</i> roof, preens out his glossy feathers, and does
honor to the sun. For two years, off and on, Hardy
had heard him, mimicking orioles and larks and sparrows
and whistling shrilly for the dog, but now for
the first time his heart answered to the wild joy of
the bird lover. The world had taken on light and
color over night, and the breeze, sifting in through
the barred window, was sweet with the fragrance of
untrampled flowers.</p>
<p>April had come, and the grass; the air was untainted;
there was no braying by the river&ndash;&ndash;the
sheep had gone. It had been bought at the price of
blood, but at last there was peace. The dreamy
<i>quah</i>, <i>quah</i> of the quail was no longer a mockery of
love; their eggs would not be broken in the nest but
the mothers would lead forth their little ones; even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_472' name='page_472'></a>472</span>
the ground-doves and the poor-wills, nesting in last
year&#8217;s sheep tracks, would escape the myriad feet&ndash;&ndash;and
all because a crazy man, hiding among the cliffs,
had shot down Jasper Swope. Without hate or pity
Hardy thought of that great hairy fighting-man; the
God that let him live would judge him dead&ndash;&ndash;and
Bill Johnson too, when he should die. The sheep
were gone and Lucy had kissed him&ndash;&ndash;these were the
great facts in the world.</p>
<p>They were sitting close together beneath the
<i>ramada</i>, looking out upon the sunlit valley and talking
dreamily of the old days, when suddenly Hardy
edged away and pointed apologetically to the western
trail. There in single file came Judge Ware in his
linen duster, a stranger in khaki, and a woman, riding
astride.</p>
<p>&#8220;There comes father!&#8221; cried Lucy, springing up
eagerly and waving her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Kitty,&#8221; added Hardy, in a hushed voice.
Not since they had come had he spoken of her, and
Lucy had respected his silence. Except for the
vague &#8220;Perhaps&#8221; with which she had answered Bill
Lightfoot&#8217;s persistent inquiries he had had no hint
that Kitty might come, and yet a vague uneasiness
had held his eyes to the trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, Lucy,&#8221; he said, drawing her back to his
side as the party dipped out of sight in the interminable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_473' name='page_473'></a>473</span>
thicket of mesquites, &#8220;why have you never
spoken of Kitty? Has anything dreadful happened?
Please tell me quick, before she comes. I&ndash;&ndash;I won&#8217;t
know what to say.&#8221; He twisted about and fixed an
eye on the doorway, but Lucy held out a restraining
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been a great secret,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and you
must promise not to tell, but Kitty has been writing
a play.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A play!&#8221; exclaimed Hardy, astounded, &#8220;why&ndash;&ndash;what
in the world is it about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About Arizona, of course,&#8221; cried Lucy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you remember how eager she was to hear you men
talk? And she collected all those spurs and quirts
for stage properties! Why, she wrote books and
books full of notes and cowboy words while she was
down here and she&#8217;s been buried in manuscript for
months. When she heard that you were having the
round-up early this year she was perfectly frantic to
come, but they were right in the midst of writing it
and she just couldn&#8217;t get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They?&#8221; repeated Hardy, mystified. &#8220;Why
who&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I forgot,&#8221; said Lucy, biting her lip. Then
in a lower voice she added: &#8220;She has been collaborating
with Tupper Browne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tupper Browne! Why, what does he know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_474' name='page_474'></a>474</span>
about Arizona?&#8221; cried Hardy indignantly, and then,
as Lucy looked away, he stopped short.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he said, and then there was a long silence.
&#8220;Well, Tupper&#8217;s a good fellow,&#8221; he remarked philosophically.
&#8220;But Lucy,&#8221; he said, starting up nervously
as the sound of horses&#8217; feet came up from
the creek bed, &#8220;you&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll do all the talking,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talking!&#8221; repeated Lucy, pausing in her flight.
&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; she called back, laughing. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that
always the woman&#8217;s part?&#8221; And then she fell upon
Kitty&#8217;s neck and kissed her. Hardy came forward
with less assurance, but his embarrassment was reduced
to a minimum by Judge Ware who, as soon as
the first greetings were over, brought forward the
mild-mannered gentleman in khaki and introduced
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Shafer,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is my superintendent,
Mr. Hardy. Mr. Shafer represents the United
States Forestry Service,&#8221; he added significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, then you must bring us good news!&#8221; cried
Hardy, holding out his hand eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the official modestly, but his
speech ended with that word.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am convinced,&#8221; began Judge Ware, suddenly
quelling all conversation by the earnestness of his demeanor.
&#8220;I am convinced that in setting aside the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_475' name='page_475'></a>475</span>
Salagua watershed as a National Forest Reserve, our
President has added to the record of his good deeds
an act of such consummate statesmanship that it will
be remembered long after his detractors are forgotten.
But for him, millions of acres of public land now set
aside as reserves would still be open to the devastation
of unrestricted grazing, or have passed irrevocably
into the power of this infamous land ring which
has been fighting on the floor of Congress to deprive
the American people of their rights. But after both
houses had passed a bill depriving the executive of
his power to proclaim Forest Reserves&ndash;&ndash;holding
back the appropriations for the Forestry Service as
a threat&ndash;&ndash;he baffled them by a feigned acquiescence.
In exchange for the appropriations, he agreed to sign
the act&ndash;&ndash;and then, after securing the appropriations,
he availed himself of the power still vested in him
to set aside this reserve and many other reserves for
our children and our children&#8217;s children&ndash;&ndash;and then,
gentlemen, true to his word, he signed the bill!&#8221;</p>
<p>Judge Ware shook hands warmly with Mr. Shafer
at the end of this speech and wished him all success in
protecting the people&#8217;s domain. It was a great day
for the judge, and as soon as Creede and the other
cowmen came in with the day&#8217;s gather of cattle he
hastened out to tell them the news.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_476' name='page_476'></a>476</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And now, gentlemen,&#8221; he said, holding up his
hand to stop the joyous yelling, &#8220;I wish to thank you
one and all for your confidence in me and in the good
faith of our Government. It called for a high order
of manhood, I am sure; but in not offering any armed
resistance to the incoming of the sheep your loyalty
has withstood its supreme test.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; inquired Creede, scratching his
head doubtfully. Then, divining the abysmal ignorance
from which the judge was speaking, he answered,
with an honest twinkle in his eye: &#8220;Oh,
that&#8217;s all right, Judge. We always try to do what&#8217;s
right&ndash;&ndash;and we&#8217;re strong for the law, when they
is any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid there hasn&#8217;t been much law up here
in the past, has there?&#8221; inquired Mr. Shafer tactfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not so&#8217;s you&#8217;d notice it,&#8221; replied the big
cowboy enigmatically. &#8220;But say, Judge,&#8221; he continued,
making a point at the old gentleman&#8217;s linen
duster, &#8220;excuse <i>me</i>, but that yaller letter stickin&#8217; out
of your pocket looks kinder familiar. It&#8217;s for me,
ain&#8217;t it? Um, thanks; this detective outfit back in
St. Louie is tryin&#8217; to make me out a millionaire, or
somethin&#8217; like that, and I&#8217;m naturally interested.&#8221;
He tore the letter open, extracted a second epistle
from its depths and read it over gravely. &#8220;Well,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_477' name='page_477'></a>477</span>
boys,&#8221; he observed, grinning cheerfully as he tucked
it away in his shaps, &#8220;my luck always did run in
bunches&ndash;&ndash;<i>I&#8217;m rich</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>He strode briskly over to the corral, caught up a
fresh horse and, riding back to the camp, began to go
through his war bag hurriedly. He was in the midst
of a feverish packing, throwing away socks and grabbing
up shirts, when a gay laugh from the house
attracted his attention. He listened for a moment
abstractedly; then he flew at his work once more,
dumping everything he had out on his bed and stuffing
what he needed back into his war bag; but when there
came a second peal of laughter, he stopped and
craned his neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;be&ndash;&ndash;dam&#8217;d!&#8221; he muttered, as he
recognized the voice, and then he flew at his work
again, manhandling everything in sight. He was
just roping his enormous bed, preparatory to depositing
it in the bunk-house, when Kitty Bonnair stepped
out of the house and came toward him, walking like a
boy in her dainty riding suit. There was a great noise
from the branding pen and as she approached he
seemed very intent upon his work, wrestling with his
bundle as if he were hog-tying a bull and using language
none too choice the while, but Kitty waited
patiently until he looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, howdy do, Mr. Creede,&#8221; she cried, smiling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_478' name='page_478'></a>478</span>
radiantly. &#8220;I got a new idea for my play just from
seeing you do that work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cowboy regarded her sombrely, took a nip or
two with his rope&#8217;s end, jerked the cords tight, and
sat down deliberately on the bundle.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; he said, wiping the sweat from his
eyes. &#8220;How&#8217;s tricks?&#8221; There was a shadow of
irony in his voice but Kitty passed it by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine and dandy,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;How are you
coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pretty good,&#8221; he conceded, rising up and surveying
the battlefield, &#8220;and I reckon I ain&#8217;t forgot
nothin&#8217;,&#8221; he added meaningly. He kicked his blanket
roll, tied his war bag behind the saddle, and hitched
up his overalls regally. &#8220;Sorry I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to see
more of you,&#8221; he observed, slipping his six-shooter
into his shaps, &#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, you aren&#8217;t <i>going</i>?&#8221; cried Kitty, aghast.
&#8220;Why, I came all the way down here to see you&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
writing a play, and you&#8217;re the hero!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-es!&#8221; jeered Creede, laughing crudely. &#8220;I&#8217;m
Mary&#8217;s little lamb that got snatched baldheaded to
make the baby laugh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re nothing of the kind,&#8221; retorted Kitty
stoutly. &#8220;You&#8217;re the hero in my play that&#8217;s going
to be <i>acted</i> some day on the stage. You kill a Mexican,
and win a beautiful girl in the last act!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_479' name='page_479'></a>479</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; commented Creede, smiling grimly,
&#8220;but say, that Mex. will keep, won&#8217;t he&ndash;&ndash;because
I&#8217;m due back in St. Louie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Kitty, clasping her hands in despair.
&#8220;St. Louis! And won&#8217;t I <i>ever</i> see you any more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you might,&#8221; conceded the cowboy magnanimously,
&#8220;if you wait around long enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I <i>can&#8217;t</i> wait! I&#8217;ve got to finish my last act,
and I came clear down here, just to hear you talk.
You can&#8217;t imagine how interesting you are, after living
up there in the city,&#8221; she added naively.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; grumbled Creede, picking up his bridle lash,
&#8220;but say, I&#8217;ve got to be goin&#8217;!&#8221; He hooked a boot
negligently into the stirrup and looked back over his
shoulder. &#8220;Anything else I can do for you?&#8221; he inquired
politely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you dear Jeff!&#8221; cried Kitty ecstatically, &#8220;yes!
Do come back here and let me tell you!&#8221; He kicked
his foot reluctantly out of the stirrup and stalked
back, huge and commanding as ever, but with a
puzzled look in his eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bend your head down, so I can whisper it,&#8221; she
coaxed, and brute-like he bowed at her bidding. She
whispered a moment eagerly, added a word, and
pushed his head away. For a minute he stood there,
thinking ponderously; then very deliberately he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_480' name='page_480'></a>480</span>
pulled his six-shooter out of his shaps and handed it
over to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but say&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he beckoned her
with an inexorable jerk of the head&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;what do <i>I</i> git,
now?&#8221; He looked down upon her as he had on the
morning they had parted, out behind the corral, and
the hot blood leaped into Kitty Bonnair&#8217;s cheeks at
the memory of that kiss. For a moment she hesitated,
twisting her trim boot into the ground, then
she drew the coveted pistol from her belt and handed
it back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, since you insist,&#8221; he said, and very sternly
he thrust the redeemed weapon back into his shaps.
A change came over him as he regarded her; there
was an austere tightening of his lips and his eyes
glowed with a light that Kitty had never seen before.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a rough deal you gave me, girl,&#8221; he
said, his voice vibrant with anger, &#8220;and I ain&#8217;t forgotten
it. You dropped your rope over my horns and
gave me a little run and then you took your turns and
<i>busted</i> me like a wild steer! And then maybe you
laughed a little,&#8221; he suggested, with a searching
glance. &#8220;No? Well, it&#8217;s all right, as far as I&#8217;m
concerned&ndash;&ndash;my hide&#8217;s whole, and I&#8217;m rope-wise&ndash;&ndash;but
I&#8217;ll tell you, Miss Kitty, if you&#8217;d jest keep this
gun of mine and shoot some feller once in a while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_481' name='page_481'></a>481</span>
we&#8217;d all enjoy it more.&#8221; He paused, and as Kitty
stood downcast before this sudden censure he smiled
to himself, and a twinkle of mischief crept into his
masterful eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t mind a little thing like that, girl,&#8221; he
said, throwing out his hands largely. &#8220;<i>You</i> don&#8217;t
lose no friends by tryin&#8217; to educate us a little&ndash;&ndash;ump-umm!
Of course I&#8217;m kinder sore over that letter,
but you look good to me yet, Kitty!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Creede!&#8221; faltered Kitty, looking up.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; asserted Creede, lowering his voice
confidentially, &#8220;they was something about you that
caught my eye the first time I saw you.&#8221; He laughed,
showing all his white teeth, and at the same time his
eyes were very grave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come over here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll tell you what
it was. No&ndash;&ndash;I won&#8217;t kiss you&ndash;&ndash;come on up close.&#8221;
Wondering at her own acquiescence, Kitty Bonnair
obeyed, and with a mysterious smile he stooped down
until his lips were close to her ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;You remind me of my girl,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;back
in St. Louie!&#8221; And then with a great laugh he broke
away and leapt triumphantly into the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Whoop-eee</i>!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;<i>Watch me fly</i>!&#8221; And
spreading his arms like a bird he thundered away
down the western trail.</p>
<p>There was a strange stillness about the old ranch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_482' name='page_482'></a>482</span>
house when Kitty came back to it and she wondered
vaguely where Lucy and Rufus were, but as she
stepped inside the dirt <i>ramada</i> the quiet seemed to lay
its spell upon her and she halted by the doorway,
waiting for a last glimpse of Jeff as he went up over
the western rim. The bawling of cattle and the shrill
yells of the cowboys no longer tempted her to the
<i>parada</i> ground&ndash;&ndash;she was lonely, and there was no
one who cared for her. Yet, somewhere within, she
could hear the murmur of voices, and at last when she
could endure it no longer she turned and entered
quickly. The big living-room where they had so
often sat together was vacant now, but Hardy&#8217;s door
was open, and as she looked in she saw them standing
together&ndash;&ndash;Lucy with downcast eyes, and Rufus,
holding both her hands. It was all very innocent and
lover-like, but when their lips met she turned and fled
to her room.</p>
<p>Half an hour later Kitty emerged from her hiding,
robed like a woman; there was a new grace about her
as she stood before them, a new dignity, and she wore
fresh flowers in her hair, forget-me-nots, picked from
among the rocks as she rode toward Hidden Water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you, my children,&#8221; she said, smiling and holding
out her hands, &#8220;I shall die an old maid.&#8221; And
then she kissed them both.</p>
